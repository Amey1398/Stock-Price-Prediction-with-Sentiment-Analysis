Yes, it is a great brand. But for us it is where the content is available not the brand. So someone in our family will talk about a show or movie and then say, it is on Amazon or NetFlix, or whatever. BTW, we have both Amazon and NetFlix subscriptions and access to YouTube, etc.

It would seem that Google could basically destroy NetFlix business almost overnight. If they contracted for the content and put it on YouTube they would be ready to roll.

11,11,2015-01-23,"Anyone else a little skeptical of Netflix's ""strong"" earnings? So I'm sure most people know by now, but Netflix stock jumped over 40% on Wednesday following their Q4 earnings announcement (now trading at about $430 per share).  I was taking a look at their financials and I wasn't too impressed with the growth rates in revenue and operating income (both were less than historic growth rates).  Obviously, analysts were impressed since the stock price jumped so high, but after taking a closer look I noticed  the reason their Net Income figure was so impressive is because in Q4 of this year they had a Tax *Benefit* of about $38 million.  This is a massive shift from their historical effective tax rate of around 35 - 40% over the last two years.  Going by historic tax figures, Netflix earnings would have been about $20 million less.

So essentially what I am saying is I believe analysts are overreacting to an amplification of the firm's earnings due to a number, that has nothing to do with operations, creating a distorted earnings number.  My bold prediction is to watch out for Netflix stock to take a hit following their Q1 earnings announcement, as analysts will move their expectations up but this will not persist as that tax benefit is a one-time number and as is the nature of deferred tax benefits - that number will reverse.

18,18,2015-02-04,"Free 10-week online course in Excel VBA from Cal Poly Pomona Hi everyone. It was suggested that I cross post this from /r/learnprogramming and /r/Excel. I am a faculty member in the Mechanical Engineering Department at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona (a.k.a. Cal Poly Pomona). We will be offering a 10-week online course titled *Introduction to Excel VBA Programming* that is open to everyone in the world for **free**. In the course, students will learn the fundamentals of Excel spreadsheets and VBA programming (e.g., Sub and Function procedures, decision structures, loops, UserForms, and arrays). No textbooks or prior knowledge of programming are required... all you need is internet access and Microsoft Excel. 

While it is impossible to cover every topic in Excel and VBA in only 10 weeks, the course will give students a strong foundation in programming logic that they could build upon in the future. Students who obtain a passing grade in the course will receive a personalized certificate of completion via email and an online badge from Cal Poly Pomona. The course officially begins on March 30, 2015 and enrollment has already started. Additional course and enrollment details can be found at the following site: [Click here to enroll](https://openeducation.blackboard.com/mooc-catalog/courseDetails/view?course_id=_219_1)

Here is a [press release](https://polycentric.csupomona.edu/2015/01/mooc-aims-to-have-10000-students/#.VMfCQy62rwY) Cal Poly Pomona put out recently about the course (that's my amazing face at the top of the article). Feel free to tell anyone who is interested in learning how to program in Excel VBA about this opportunity. Our goal is to have 10000 participants and about 1600 people have enrolled thus far.

I feel the analysis falls towards the optimistic side of the spectrum, but I do not take Apple watch into account, so if that adds a few percent to the revenue, it might be realistic. I don’t think this is worth basing any decisions on, but I found it kind of interesting. Current analyst estimates are lower than these values.  One issue is that this assumes/results in a 10% surprise in Q2 revenue versus projections given.

Even given a more conservative estimate, the yoy growth numbers are very good. Yes, I know that the catch phrase of this sub is ""this is already priced in."" 

EDIT: completely unreliable price projection. If we cut $0.32 from projected EPS, and lower p/e to 14, you get a price of $126. I think this is where the stock should be today. I can see the stock trading in 132-135 range if q2 matches my numbers.

31,31,2015-03-19,"Clarification on Unlevering Financial Statements (x-post from /r/securityanalysis) Spending some time with Stephen Penman's *Accounting for Value*, which I've found to be very insightful, thought provoking, and challenging (in a good way) to my current value approach on investing. He spends some time talking about ""unlevering"" the financials to separate the enterprise results of the business from its financing activities.  In practice, is the purpose of doing this to strip away the noise that financing can bring into the numbers?  To value a company purely on the basis of its operating results, irregardless of how it may be financed?  Thanks for the help!

*I apologize in advance if my question seems vague.  I'm on my second read-through, still working to wrap my head around the full implications of his valuation approach.*

Some quotes from the book: 

* ""Unlever the accounting numbers and develop the valuation from these unlevered numbers.  In doing so, one protects from paying for profitability and growth generated by leverage.""

* ""Unlevering the accounting involves separating those accounting numbers that have to do with the business operations from those that have to do with financing activities.... To demonstrate, let's start with the balance sheet under GAAP and IFRS and identify assets and liabilities associated with the business enterprise and those associated with the financing of the business... **Operating assets** are those employed in the business, like receivables, inventory, and plant. **Operating liabilities** are liabilities incurred in the course of business, like accounts payable, deferred revenues, and accrued expenses. **Financial liabilities** are the debt from raising cash to finance the business, like bonds payable and bank loans, whereas **financial assets** are (interest-bearing) debt in which the firm invests to hold ""excess cash"" not required for business operations (like cash equivalents and short-term debt investments) ....

I wanted to look at Microsoft because it's a really visible company. Looking at the graphs, I have some questions:

- Really noob question: What is the reason for a general upwards or downwards trend? How does a company's profit translate to a change in its stock price? Who decides this?

- From ~April 2013 to ~January 2015, MSFT had pretty steady growth. Why is this? What made it continuously keep gaining? Is it just that everyone just believed in them?

- What the heck happened on January 26th that started this most recent downward trend? The stock hasn't recovered since then. Why does it keep going down?

- If you wanted to invest in MSFT, how would you decide when to buy into this stock? It seems tantalizing to buy some stock if it drops a bit more because when it bounces back, you could make a nice return. But how do you decide when? Obviously this is dependent on your personal ideas but I don't have a clue how to analyze this.

38,38,2015-04-12,"Question: Two-Stage Dividend Discount Model I'm currently working on an assignment where we are to calculate the prices for Pt to Pt+10. As the title says, it's a two stage growth situation. I know that growth in (g1) is greater than growth in stage 2 (g2)... and that the firm becomes a ""normal"" firm in stage 2, with a normal payout ratio and normal P/E-ratio, in this case it's equal to 5 *(average, which isn't that normal on todays market hehe...)*


The firm becomes ""normal"" after year t+10.


I also have the following information:

    10   = T
    1    = Div. year t 
    5    = EPS year t
    0,2  = y
    0,08 = EPS growth per year (for 10 years) = Dividend growth per year
    0,10 = rE (cost of equity)
    5    = K (""normal"" P/E ratio)


*Now, to my question...*

According to my calculations *P0 = Pt = 28,32* and *P10 = Pt+T = 49,975* *(rounded)*

But how do i calculate P1 to P9 *(Pt+1 to Pt+9)* in the stage 1 growth period??

Also, can i expect the P/E-ratio to be constant during the stage 1 growth period?


**EDIT:**

**The question is solved!** I am supposed to use the ""multi year pricing"" formula for stage 1 in the DDM. *P1 = (Div2 + P2)/(1+rE)*

The Credit Union Times recently reported that ""the number of weekly mobile bankers now equal those who use the branch”. This is a major shifting point for banking that has occurred faster than expected.

Javelin Strategy and Research reports that one in four smart phone users primarily use a mobile device to access their checking account. Mobile users are using their phones and tablets to access mobile apps and mobile website for banking. This number may soon increase with the introduction of the Apple watch. Currently online-users are the largest group consisting of 39% of customers, followed by mobile-users at 23% and branch-first customers at 17%.

Who exactly are mobile-users? They tend to be younger, female and have children in the household. While branch-first customers are male, older an wealthier who still use paper and pen to keep track on their accounts. However, nearly half of mobile-users have entered a branch in the last 3 months to ask customer service questions.

A lot of financial analysts/researchers spend hours everyday browsing stocktwits, twitter, RSS feeds, Bloomberg, WSJ, Factiva, supplemented with hundreds of google alerts. 

Headlines aren't informative enough, skimming the contents takes too long, and google alerts are inconsistent. The goal of Agolo is to automate that process.
 
Agolo ingests news from many sources (e.g. Twitter, RSS feeds…), automatically groups related stories together, and creates a summary around that collection in real time. 

You can see a sample here, which only used tweets as the initial source:

* [NYC, East Village Explosion](http://www.agolo.com/snapshot/55146160c0fd562eb55bc533/)

Right now, it's a first version, and doesn't have all the features that we plan on building. I'd really love to be able to get a few alpha testers, which will directly impact what features get built.

If you have any questions, comment below, and if you're interested in trying it out, send me a PM or [subscribe here](http://agolo.us9.list-manage2.com/subscribe?u=5819ca331d1c6bcb2574709e5&id=49727e3841)

When AAPL decided to split, I bought it because I concluded that the more attractive price would attract more investors. Although the two companies are different in many senses, I think I see a pattern between the two splits.

Bought AAPL around 99$ and sold around 137$
I would be thrilled if I could do the same for NFLX.

Additionally, I would argue that when and if GOOG splits, it will see a rise in share price as a result of a more attractive price.

71,71,2015-07-09,"Give it to me straight: Will my degree in mathematics mean anything to employers in the finance industry? How do I save myself from irrelevancy before it happens? Heyo, I'm currently a college freshman who just finished up freshman year. I go to a community college in California with the intention of transferring to a higher end UC school. As I am aware that prestige matters quite a bit in finance, I am aiming for UC Berkeley, and I have the stats to get in, but UCLA/UCSD are more realistic. 

Anyway, I am majoring in Mathematics/Applied Mathematics/Statistics. I have scoured through many of the course lists at all 3 of these schools, and many allow for students to take courses in various disciplines as long as they're relatively math intensive. 

So, I plan to take multiple Probability/Stats/Finance/Economics courses along with some CS as well. Also, this coming Fall I plan to purchase a little Dell laptop for a couple hundred bucks to begin learning Microsoft Excel as I understand that the industry standard is basically a mastery of Excel. (I have a Mac for personal use and I hear MS Office sucks on it, so whatever.)

Anyway, am I at a disadvantage here? I just hear so many horror stories about unpaid internships being the new ""entry level job."" It's ridiculous out there. How useful am I going to be? I plan on working hard to get any sort of internship next, and the following summer. Preferably at a bank or financial institution, but really anywhere that will take me.  

I don't really know what part of finance I want to work in, because I haven't had any experience in any parts at all, so I'm going in blind here. I'm considering just taking a basic finance/accounting class at my community college, but I really want to focus on my Math classes and not ruin my GPA for transfer. 

Lets say I gain a good understanding of MS Office, I get a good amount of math done, and I have basic understanding of finance...Do I stand a chance? I'm not trying to get into IB here, not going for Wall Street, but hey, California is a competitive market. 

**TL;DR: What skills can a math major learn in order to be attractive to finance internships? What kind of places should I be applying to/trying to make connections with?**

On a side note, I interviewed about 4 months ago for a summer assistant position at an investment firm nearby my house. The man who interviewed me showed me around the whole floor, even gave me a few books on investing, finance, etc. (Intelligent Investor ftw!) 

He and I ended up emailing back and forth a couple times the following weeks and he ended up not choosing me for the position, but told me to definitely stay in touch. I'm 19, and I don't know much about this industry, but did he really want me to stay in touch? He said ""This industry is all about the connections you make, and you just made your first one, stay in touch!"" ...How do I do that? I figure in a month or two I'll email him asking some question about the industry, and then a month or two after that I'll ask if he knows of any internships opening up around? I get that I have to stay relevant in this guys mind, but what's the best way to do so?

For anyone who read this the whole way through, thank you. Your help is well appreciated.

75,75,2015-07-16,"Netflix vs HBO In light of the Netflix earnings yesterday and the subsequent stock pop, I still fail to understand why people are so hot on Netflix stock. 

Currently, Netflix is valued at $50b and time warner (parent of HBO) is valued at $75b. HBO has more penetration (currently) and just flat out better content. Netflix has better technology but i don’t think much difference to consumers in the long run. 

And let's be honest... NFLX content is still second rate compared to HBO. If I were HBO, I wouldn't take NFLX lightly and I'm sure over the years they'll get even better content, but right now I would still much rather be able to watch Sopranos, The Wire, Curb Your Enthusiasm, True Detective, Game of Thrones, Silicon Valley, etc instead of a crappy season 4 of Arrested Development, and that show about a gangster in Iceland. I also cannot remember the last time there was a movie on Netflix that I was interested in, and they took away King of the Hill I just about lost it. 

Am I missing something about the ease of international expansion for TWC vs Netflix? Or something about the cost structure? I know HBO is still somewhat tied to cable providers, but I don't see that as being any more of a long-term hindrance to success than Netflix's 2nd rate content is to theirs. 

To me, as an investor, it comes down to would I rather own a a piece of Netflix at $50b, or a piece of TWC at $75b where you get HBO AND......

79,79,2015-07-22,"Just put my first 2.5k into the stock market- Good time to add more? A little big of background- 20yo college student, studying finance at a highly competitive program. I initially started out this morning with the intention of investing into a lower-risk portfolio and letting it sit to grow. With this in mind, my portfolio now plays out like this:

5 shares each in NFLX and DIS
10 shares in AAPL--> I chose this specifically because many have said that it's a good buy-in time for Apple. I don't see Apple dropping continuously, but the slump in the last couple days has bumped the price down to a comfortable pricing.
3 shares in FIT--> This is where I'm getting closer to speculation. Just bought a Fitbit and love the product, definitely see it going further in the future. 

Here is my current dilemma. My parents are encouraging me to mess around with the market to try to make some (relatively) big money before school starts again (read: invest in riskier companies), at which point I will put the majority of my money into more stable companies e.g. AAPL, NFLX, what have you. 

I plan on injecting into my account a further 2-4000$ to play around with, as they have promised a level of ""insurance"" to essentially recoup my losses. 

I know that at my age it's ok to be investing in riskier firms. However, I'm curious as to where there is a limit? Is it ok for me to be about 50/50 on safe/risky positions?

80,80,2015-07-24,"Amazon Stock Price: Killing Me Softly Well f**k.  Amazon (AMZN) just announced that they made $92MM last quarter versus a loss of $126MM in the same quarter last year.  So what did investors do?  They decided to reward Amazon with an $85 per share increase after hours.  That’s an additional $40Billion or so in value added.  So now they are officially worth more than Wal-Mart.  And that is beyond stupid…and here is why:

In the last twelve months (TTM – Trailing Twelve Months), Wal-Mart has $485Billion in revenue.  Amazon has $96Billion in the last 12 months.  So Wal-Mart, by sales, is 5 times larger.  But it is worth LESS?!?!?! Ok…maybe it’s about profit…

In the last twelve months, Wal-Mart has made $16Billion in net income.  Amazon has LOST $188MM.  Wait.  So Wal-Mart has MADE A PROFIT of $16Billion and Amazon has LOST $188,000,000….LOST….Oh but wait, everyone says it’s about the growth…

I know.  So Amazon’s BEST argument is that they are investing in more and more things to make the experience for users better and grow their media collection and blah blah blah.  Ok. Fine.  Then why can’t you make money off of $96B EVEN DOING THAT?!?!

Their best margins ever were almost 4%…Wal-Mart, which is brick and mortar and supposed to cost more, is higher on average.  So let’s assume that they hit 4% in profit margin in the long run because of their investments and they finally start to turn a profit…on $96Billion in sales, that’s profit of $3.8Billion. So at a market cap of $265Billion, that’s a price to earnings ratio of 70 still! Which is still 5 times more than historical averages especially for such a mature company because REMEMBER, Amazon is  a MATURE company. It isn’t a start-up! It’s been around for 20 years!

Sure it is! They surprised everyone by growing 20% from last year’s same quarter.  Ok. So let’s assume they continue to grow 20% per year and let’s assume Wal-Mart only grows at 3% per year…how long will it take for Amazon to catch up?  Remember, assuming 20% growth per year is HIGHLY unlikely…is it impossible? No.  But even Amazon’s growth since 2007 has slowed significantly.  From 2007 to 2008, before the big recession, Amazon’s revenue grew 30%.  So there is going to be a slow down.  Have they had better years since then?  Sure, but here is their year over year growth since 2007: 30%, 27.9%, 39.5%, 40.5%, 27%, 21.9%, 19.5%, and this last quarter they SURPRISED everyone with 20% growth.

So back to my point: Let’s assume 20% growth for Amazon every year and only 3% for Wal-Mart every year…In 10 years, Amazon’s revenue will be $595Billion and Wal-Mart’s revenue will be $651Billion! They still haven’t caught up to Wal-Mart! And even at $595Billion in revenue and 4% profit margin, which I remind you they have never achieved, they will have profit of $24Billion which is still only 10 times earnings of TODAY’S MARKET VALUE!…which is about where stocks should sell for during a bad bear market.  So let’s even assume that it should sell for the same multiple as Wal-Mart, which is around 15 or so historically. That’s a valuation of $360Billion which is 35% higher than today.

Soooooo…follow me here…Today’s market value of Amazon is 35% lower than what it should be if it were to grow at 20% per year for 10 more years AND have profit margins it has never seen before.  Does it sound optimistic?  Absolutely.  Yes, Amazon is winning the popularity contest right now, but no companies does that for decades.  Microsoft didn’t. Google didn’t.  Dell didn’t. IBM didn’t.  No one does.  And sometime in there, it will massively correct.  And when it does, it will be ugly.  Until then, my bank account looks ugly.

84,84,2015-07-31,"NFLX: Some Things to Consider PE is not really the best measure for a growth company like Netflix. I mean, would a 200 PE be better?  Or a 150 PE? It's a meaningless number if you can't predict the growth rate. 

Looking at the membership numbers from their annual report, it looks like the growth rates are falling fast. Domestic streamers grew 17% in 2014 vs 23% in 2013. International streamers grew 67% in 2014 vs 73% in 2013. Domestic dvd'ers are on a decline, making total domestic memberships growth rate 11% in 2014 vs 14% in 2013.

So you have to guess where and when these growth rates converge. Which Im convinced is impossible in all but the most broad sense, but that's just me. 

Then you have to figure out the revenue per member. Which is easy. The nice thing is that as the membership growth rates slow down, the revenue per member actually goes up. This may seem counter-intuitive, but it's because new members don't pay for a full year of service. Also, Netflix inflates it's membership numbers by including those on free trials. (I can't find how many trials actually convert to paying memberships, but Im guessing it's high.)

Then you have to look at their fixed costs growth rate and their variable costs. What makes Netflix attractive is the variable cost per member is likely negligible for streamers. 

My main concern with Netflix is their fixed costs, because they have no competitive advantage that I can see. Anyone with enough capital can work out contracts with media companies and start streaming content for a monthly subscription. As more competitors enter the space, you'll see increased costs as bidding wars break out for content. Original content is a differentiator, but if every provider has their own original content then it becomes a matter of customer preference. 

The only defense I've heard is that it hasn't happened yet. Amazon is trying (unsuccessfully apparently) and Google and Apple are seemingly content to stick to a PPV model. But bumbling competitors isn't a competitive advantage in the long run.

Case in point, Hulu is a joint venture between NBC, FOX, and ABC. So far it's a dumpster fire. It only has 4 million subs compared to Netflix's 64 million. http://www.statisticbrain.com/hulu-statistics/ But what concerns me about Hulu is what it represents. In the future, Netflix may start seeing real competition from its suppliers. Or maybe they'll continue to play nice. I have no idea. But it's just something for you to consider.

111,111,2015-09-27,"Google Finance Stock Screener Output to Spreadsheet? I need to do some basic data analysis on the output of the Google Finance stock screener.  Basically, I like to look at dividend payout ratio, which means dividends (per share) divided by earnings (per share).  I do an initial screen of companies with positive earnings and positive dividends, and then after that I like to look at payout ratio.  To do that it make sense to put the data in a spreadsheet.  I'll be happy to elaborate on why I like to look at this if anyone cares, but here's my issue...

I have tried with Excel, Google spreadsheet, and WPS spreadsheet.  In my hands none of them recognize the output of the Google Finance Stock Screener as a table they can download.  

If anyone remembers the old Yahoo Java stock screener, it was imperfect, but would output data to a spread sheet.

I realize in advance that I may be asking a stupid question, or one dealt with before, but does anyone have a method of auto-outputting the results of a Google Finance screen as CSV or any spreadsheet format?

It's extremely easy but extremely boring to copy and past it one screen at a time into a spread sheet...

CLARIFICATION - here's an example stock screen using Google Finance.  It's a nice tool, and returns over 5000 stocks with this example screen. http://imgur.com/gallery/d0JlGqo/new

What I'd like to do is export the results of this screen into a spread sheet - the selected data on all 5000 stocks - so that I can so some extra things that you can't screen for in Google Finance (such as screen for payout ratio, as I mentioned above).

Mobile ads are like 37% of Google's revenues. Ad blocking affects said revenues, but this is more of a problem for the ad buyers, who directly pay Google. Google pays ad blockers to let their ads through.

I'm thinking in the worst case, Google's overhead costs simply are going up. Not that there is currently any material impact to the viability of their ads, or a change in sentiment yet amongst ad buyers (everyone else).

Anyway, none of this is positive for Google, as any minor blip in their mobile ad business will drastically affect their stock price.

126,126,2015-10-22,"Popcorn Time! Netflix (NFLX) Just Lost A Major Competitor. You see, there's this thing called ""Popcorn Time"". Popcorn Time is an app that's available for PCs and Android smartphones, and which is kind of a Netflix on steroids. It has every kind of TV show imaginable, along with a massive selection of streaming movies, including many recent blockbusters. Popcorn Time relies on bittorrent sharing to provide an experience much like Netflix's, but without having to host massive amounts of data or needing a content delivery network.

Unlike most bittorrent clients, Popcorn Time is as user-friendly as Netflix - you just search for a movie you want to see and press play. After a bit of buffering, Popcorn Time streams your movie just like Netflix. And Popcorn Time is also free, which kind of makes it very competitive with Netflix. Finally, Popcorn Time is illegal in most places since it's basically piracy as the content authors receive no compensation for its usage.
So why am I saying that Netflix just got good news? Well, as it turns out, there was quite a bit of disagreement within the Popcorn Time team regarding the direction they wanted to take it in. Some of this disagreement no doubt was prompted by rumors of an impending large lawsuit against Popcorn Time and those behind it.

This disagreement led to the defections of a large number (5 members) of developers yesterday. And as of yesterday, Popcorn Time stopped working (this happened because the developer holding the keys to the domain was one of those who left). What this means is that overnight, Netflix lost perhaps its largest competitor ever!

134,134,2015-11-10,"Is the US Stock Market reacting incorrectly to crude oil prices? It seems I have two comments, that may or may not be related:

1) It seems as if recently the stock market reacts positively for crude oil price increases and negatively for crude price decreases. This doesn't seem to make sense to me given that the US is a net importer of crude. A quick Google search look like US produces ~9.5M barrels per day, and still imports ~6M barrels per day (putting total consupmtion at 15.5M/day). For the US production, my simple mind considers this equal, since $$ from US citizens are going to US companies. However the 6M in imports is $$ going outside the US. If gas prices went down, wouldn't this mean in aggregate we are spending less money on cost of business, meaning higher profits for other companies/citizens? I understand that possibly the systemic risk of bad loans and companies going under are a concern, but does it really outweigh the billions of $$ being saved on an aggregate level? Shouldn't the stock market cheer for oil prices going down? 

2) Recently, I see a lot of analysis on earnings in the stock market seem to exclude energy in the calculations...e.g. ""If you take out the energy sector, 3Q earnings are up x% y/y."" This seems invalid and very dangerous. If oil prices had not dropped, many Americans would have less money to spend on other goods. Every time I fill up I have ~$20 more than I would have had at previous 
oil prices. This money has to go somewhere, and while yes, some of it might go to savings/debt payments, I would argue a lot probably goes into additional spending. Therefore you can't just exculde energy earnings, because the drop in earnings in those sectors have (probably?) boasted earnings in other sectors, as there is more money to be spent.

It's interesting... Looking at their charts for the year, all of them started a pretty dramatic upward swing beginning back in the 3Q. Very different than the rest of the market. 

I know lots of folks, including CNBC on an almost daily basis, have been talking up ""FANG"" all year. 

Often times it is advised to wait for a dip and buy, but with all these stocks when there has been a dip, at most it has set the price back three or four months and recovered within a couple months and so one has to wonder if it was worth waiting three months to buy something at the price the stock was when they first started thinking about it. On the other hand, if this is a bubble for these stocks then maybe a real opportunity is finally approaching. 

So what are your opinions... Is this a bubble?  Or are they still a good buy?

145,145,2015-12-28,"Careers in Investment Banking & Equity Research **My background:** I graduated from a top 20 school this May  majoring in finance and math and began work as an investment banking analyst at a boutique investment bank.  I have interned in the past at a well-known asset manager (active investing) and one of the country's largest private equity firms.

-------------------------------------------------------

**Investment Banking:** This is by far the most popular entry point out of undergrad.  It preserves a high degree of flexibility towards future careers and shows that you can work long hours under tight deadlines. Investment bankers, at an analyst role, are typically in excel and powerpoint producing various analyses.

Investment banking mostly deals with mergers & acquisitions (M&A), debt issuance (bonds), and equity issuance (IPO).  My boutique deals primarily with M&A, so I can explain this in the most detail.  We are paid a fee to either sell a company or buy a company for the best price possible for our client.  Like a real estate agent, we are there to maximize value.  In either case, the analyses are similar.  

*Accretion/Dilution Analysis:* This looks at earnings per share (EPS) of the bidder (the buying company). This is simply net income (revenue less expenses) divided by the share count of a company.  This will change when a company acquires another company.  Revenue and expenses will increase by the revenue and expenses of the seller.  In addition, the company will be acquired using either (1) the bidder's cash balance, (2) a debt issuance, (3) stock issuance, or (4) some combination of the prior ways.

(1) The only additional expense is the opportunity cost of the foregone interest (this is typically very small).  This is why analysts are clamoring for Apple to make acquisitions.  Apple has a large cash balance that is earning little-to-nothing, and they could be buying companies with it.

(2) There will be interest expense due to the new debt raised.

(3) The company will have to issue shares to acquire the company, so its share count will increase, increasing the denominator in earnings per share.  Obviously, hopefully earnings will increase as well.

An acquisition is generally thought of as ""good"" if it is accretive (increases the buyer's EPS) within the next few years, and ""bad"" if it is dilutive (decreases the buyer's EPS).  This is too simple, however, because the buyer should consider long-term planning.  For example, in Facebook's $1 billion acquisition of Instagram, the deal was dilutive for a long-time.  They paid $1 billion, but Instagram was making no money.  However, over the long-term, it was a great strategic fit and Facebook was able to maximize the value of the company.

*Discounted Cash Flow Analysis:*  Under this analysis, one projects a company's future cash flows, including a terminal value.  Then, these future cash flows are discounted back to the present and summed to determine the overall value of a company.

With financial independence, my spreadsheet is a ""snowball"" calculation in which I save a given amount per year, and these savings grow at market returns to reach a given amount near my retirement goal. 

A discounted cash flow is basically the opposite of that. A company will make (based on estimates, obviously not reliable for most cases) a certain amount each year -- this determines the value of a company.  However, as always, I prefer the company to make this value sooner rather than later.  Say if Tesla, for example, will not actually produce cash flow for 20 years.  At an 8% discount rate, a cash flow 20 years from now is worth 1 / (1.08^20) = 1 / 4  -- one quarter what it would be if it were produced today.  Wow!  Anyway, this analysis is another way of determining the value of a company that is being bought, sold, or raising money in an IPO (initial public offering).

In investment banking, pay is somewhere is the area of 130-160k (including bonus) for a first-year analyst.  First-year associates (after 3 years of analyst or out of an MBA program), will make 250-325k.  This is at bulge bracket firms (Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, Citi, JP Morgan, UBS, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Barclays) and elite boutique firms.  **Hours are 65-100 hours per week.** Most firms, however, and now instituting weekend policies.  I am guaranteed off from 8pm on Friday to 9am Sunday, so if I wanted to have a girlfriend, I could.  It's extremely nice to know that you can make plans for a given day of the week, and it wasn't this way in the past. On a typical day, I get up at 8, am in the office by 9:30, and leave around 11. Dinner and taxi home are paid for. The pay and intellectual stimulation are great, but the main advantage is the career path flexibility.  With the ability to work hard and work smart proven, I can move to many different related fields with some of the following: more pay, better hours, and better type of work.

**Equity Research:** Equity researchers model company financials and rate various stocks.  For example, a consumer/retail analyst might cover Nike, Under Armor, Lulu Lemon, and 5-6 other names.  They attend industry events, get a feel for the companies and meet their management teams, and become all-around experts on the industry.  Hours are likely 50-80 a week, depending on the firm, with additional hours during earnings season, when the analysts will almost always publish updates on the companies they follow. The main analysis for this type of job is a simple 3-statement model, which covers the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement.  If you can do a personal income statement and balance sheet / net worth, you can do this with some training.  A 3-statement model helps put a value on a company.

There are two types of equity research jobs, sell-side and buy-side.  Sell-side sells their research to buy-side firms who then use it to decide whether or not to BUY securities, such as hedge funds and large asset managers.  Buy-side researchers give their research & opinion directly to the portfolio managers that make final decisions.

Hedge funds hire these equity research analysts to help them make decisions on which securities to buy.  A hedge fund typically raises funds from pensions, endowments, and the wealthy, and uses them to actively invest in public securities.  They are often paid a 2% fee on the total capital they invest, and take 20% of their returns. The employees are highly compensated and will also make huge bonuses if the fund has a high return.

**Active asset managers and hedge funds have a huge amount of resources at their disposal, including meetings with the company's management and expensive calls with industry experts.  They bring efficiency to the markets. They are why you should not try to actively invest as an individual investor.**

**Private Equity / Venture Capital:**  Private equity firms buy companies (either public companies or private companies) and take them private. They often put on high amounts of leverage, which will increase returns (in upside cases) and shield the companies from taxes via an increased interest expense.  They attempt to back strong management teams and companies with stable cash flows. They will often make operating improvements, such as reducing administrative expenses, better sourcing of materials, or expanding into a new product line.  

Growth capital firms invest to help a company grow.  They help firms roll-out nationwide, such as restaurants or retail chains.

Venture capital firms invest in a large number of early-stage companies, knowing that many will fail but hoping that one or two might become the next Facebook.

-------------------------------------------------

**How to Get In:**

*Out of Undergrad:* The following are hugely important, and they are generally given in order of importance:

1) Attend a top school, such as an ivy
2) GPA above 3.6, preferably above 3.8
3) Internships in similar roles: do whatever needed to do these, including loans or taking a second job during an unpaid internship
4) Examples of leadership (club president, etc)

After this, there are numerous technical and 'fit' interviews to prepare for.

*NOT out of undergrad:* Usually one goes through an MBA and off to investment banking.  It's often not possible to get an investing role post-MBA without having an investing role pre-MBA.

*Backdoor:*  I think one aspect that is really overlooked is the ability to specialize.  While I am (happily) a generalist in my current position, we have a lot of senior bankers with detailed experience in the sectors they cover.  If you are an engineer, you will be able to talk with and will have a stronger background for an ""industrials"" group. If you have experience at a tech firm, you will have a stronger background for a ""technology"" group.  I am on a lot of deals in the healthcare space, and its quite tough for me to understand, because a lot of it is description of molecules and the like.

This is getting really long, so I'll stop here for now and add anything I missed in the comments.

Except for FB, Ive been watching all these. I dont know much about FB's acquisitions. Oculus VR, Instagram, WhatsApp, and the 50 some others over the past years... I know of them, but Im not much other than topical information. I dont like FB as an investment because I think it will dwindle in use a la MySpace, though I dont have anything to substantiate that.  

I like Amazon and Netflix because I use both frequently and want them to succeed. They both have big plans for expansion and seem like good investments at currently low prices. 

It seems like Apple is losing its share of the phone market and I personally feel like its products are overvalued, but many other people would likely disagree with that. (As I type this on my iPhone.)

Then the ubiquitous Google, the company so well known, their name has become a verb. They have so many projects and are involved in so many tech facets that they will almost certainly be around for a long time.

investors.com

With Netflix (NFLX) investing heavily in its global expansion, Wall Street is expecting the Internet TV service to report its lowest earnings per share in over three years when it posts first-quarter results after the close Monday.

Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Netflix to earn 3 cents a share in Q1, down 40% from the year-earlier quarter. That would be the company’s lowest EPS total since the fourth quarter of 2012, when it reported 2 cents in earnings per share.

Netflix sales are seen rising 25% to $1.965 billion in the March quarter when it completed its international expansion, excluding China.

Analysts don’t see EPS growth returning at Netflix until the fourth quarter.

For the next several quarters, the focus of investors will be on subscriber growth and whether Netflix can continue to add new customers at a quick pace.

In the December quarter, Netflix added 5.59 million new streaming subscribers, bringing its total to 74.76 million subscribers worldwide.

195,195,2016-05-24,"Contact the FCC to stop/drastically raise data caps. You can copy/paste my submission, if you want: 

In March of 2014 Sandvine's Global Internet Phenomena reported the average data used by ""cord cutters"" per month was 212GB. This was exclusively with HD content, which Netflix estimates to be about 3GB per hour of streaming. With the addition & move to UltraHD (4K) Netflix estimates the data streaming will be 7GB per hour. My provider, AT&T, just implemented a 600GB cap per month for any plans between 12MB/s - 75MB/s. This cap would limit streaming services like Netflix & HBO NOW to 6 hrs & 45 min a day for older HD technology and 2 hrs & 50 min a day for UltraHD (4K). 

Remember, this is just the daily allotment for replacing TV with online streaming. This doesn't include household data useage for video chatting (Skype), email, music (Spotify & Pandora),  online gaming (PS4/XBOX, smartphone, tablet, or PC), or anything downloaded from a cloud. 

These caps are for a time when the internet wasn't an integral part of our every day lives. They are outdated for today's standard, and we are only going to use much more data year after year. Please put a stop to them.

203,203,2016-07-14,"I sold all my Apple stock. I've been buying this stock all year ranging in price from $106 down to $90, average price of about $96.

I sold it all today. After analysis, I'm just not sure wtf this company is doing anymore. I've been a big fan of Apple since 2008 when I first bought my Macbook Pro, then iPhone, and pretty much everything after that.

This company is a shadow of its former self. Sure they generate tons of cash, but 90% of that is overseas. They are borrowing money to pay dividends. The company seems to get more loaded with debt by the year, which was never the case under Jobs.

I honestly don't like companies that buyback a ton of stock. This tells me Apple is out of ideas. Tim Cook is robbing this company blind.

They've been spending a fortune in R&D, yet all we have new under Tim Cook is a Watch that collects dust on the nightstand. Sure, they are looking into cars, but....cars???

The Mac line of computers never seem to get updated anymore, yet they'll release 3 iPad size versions and a couple of iPhone versions in a year. I just read a report that Mac sales are on a decline and they've lost what little market share they have, mostly due to the lack of upgrades to the hardware they used to be on the forefront on.

This combined with declining sales of their bread and butter iPhone? Yikes 

Judging by WWDC recently, Apple is truly out of ideas and lost its way. Stickers in the messaging app? Ok. Default apps would go a long way for me but whatever.

Plus, I have to wonder why the stock is so cheap. I've been picking it up all year as I've said, but I think investors realize there's no real future with this company anymore. They've got stagnant. I've owned the stock off and on since 2009 so I've made some gains, but I was hoping this round would be the last who-rah.

This stock has done nothing even in the face of the Brexit rally of the past couple of weeks. Zilch. No where. Sideways. Whatever you want to call it, Apple is lagging behind the market and I'm not just talking about the stock market.

The fundamentals of this company has drastically changed.

Perhaps...PERHAPS, once I see this stock in the low 80's and Apple shows some sign of innovation and a new product or two, that'll be the appropriate time to pick it up again.

But for now. I'm out.

# Description
Netflix is an Internet based entertainment / television network. The Company's members can watch original series, documentaries and feature films online. Revenues come from monthly membership fees for services consisting of streaming content. 

Though with over 80 million subscribers...we all know what they folks do!


## Recent financials 

So sure there is growth and the profit line scrapes along, but the thing that catches my eye is the *delta* in the top line. The business added $1.3bn of sales in 2015 on top of adding $1.1bn in 2004. i.e. the machine is accelerating. 

The current forecast is for sales of $8.7bn in 2016, i.e up $1.9bn. And for 2017 the forecast is $10.7bn, up $2.0bn. So Wall Street thinks the acceleration is here to stay. And if any of the other tech players' history is repeated, acceleration usually implies dominance, market power and cash flow. 

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $6.8bn | $5.5bn | $4.4bn | $3.6bn | $3.2bn|
|EPS | $0.28 | $0.62 | $0.26 | $0.04 | $0.59|

## Competition

Talking competition in their filings:

> The market for entertainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. We compete against other entertainment video providers, such as multichannel video programming distributors, Internet-based movie and TV content providers (including those that provide pirated content), video gaming providers and DVD rental outlets and more broadly against other sources of entertainment that our members could choose in their moments of free time. 

So that means the cable players, the content players, even the big internet players. 

Unsurprisingly, given it's business doesn't have ""legacy"" infrastructure it's margins are high. Clearly margins are more like the internet giants than the media giants. Fortunately!

Though returns aren't great, probably given they are in investment mode. 

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|

## Cash / Debt?

Netflix, Inc. has $539M of net debt. That is 1x its latest operating profit. So no real concerns here. 

# Wall Street thinks?

The professionals on Wall Street have a $105 for Netflix, Inc. and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. That implies an upside of 13% to their target. So it's hard to get excited, and worse, in the last 3 months the brokers price target has come down from $120, though the stock's not budged.

# Valuation

And here's where a *value* guy like me usually gives up: 300x earnings. But should I give up? 

I need an envelope:

* Say I'm willing to invest if I can double my money in 5 years. It'll be worth $80bn. 
* Pay 20x earnings in 5 years, and it would need to be generating $4bn of net profit. 
* At a 20% margin that would be $20bn of sales. Up from $8.5bn today. And implies an annual 15-20% topline growth. 
* Doable, yes if the business is now accelerating, but it would likely be a rocky ride!

# Dividends
Netflix, Inc. is not forecast to pay a dividend this year. Nor would I want one! Grow baby, grow!

# Catalysts
In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 4% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of 4% with sales up 26% in the last 6 months. 

Catalysts for $NFLX seem to be pretty obvious... it's all the KPIs, subscribers, churn, revenue per sub and maybe a look at margins. The occasional hit or miss with the original programming will move it too. 

But none of it matters :) Either the business is accelerating or it's not. Agree?

Create some real shareholder value by lining their pockets with cash! 2.1% is a measly dividend when you consider that Apple has over $230 billion in the bank and could literally DOUBLE its divvy to over 4% without feeling the pain. 

Its payout ratio is a laughable 26% right now, about half of what respectable mega-cap dividend stocks pay their investors.

My theory? Apple is in denial that its years of hypergrowth are in the rearview mirror, and it's keeping oodles of cash around ""just in case"" they need to invest super heavily in something. Ain't gonna happen.

221,221,2016-08-28,"r/StockMarket Stock Picking Challenge for the week of (8/29 - 9/2) OK, so I'm attempting to give this one more whirl on our sub to see if there is any interest at all from the community here.

I do this at another community that I'm apart of, and these contests are not only highly successful but also quite competitive in that the more folks who participate and post picks the more competitive these contests get!

This contest is kinda similar to what /u/ghostofgbt was asking the other day only it's different as /u/ghostofgbt was asking for everyone to post tickers that you wanted him to analyze in a video that he would be delivering for you guys (which BTW, awesome stuff there Chris!!)

Here I'm asking for you guys to post tickers in which you believe will perform the best this week...

**If you want to be eligible to participate in this week's contest here is what you need to do (REQUIRED!):**
> * 1.) Post 2 tickers (ex. AAPL = Apple) but pick 2 not just 1...
> * 2.) Choose either Long or Short for each ticker (Obviously LONG - if you think it will go up ... or SHORT - if you think it will go down this week...)
> * 3.) Both of your picks MUST each be at least $2 minimum!

**Contest Rules (READ THESE AND FOLLOW THEM!):**
> * 1.) No OTC or Foreign companies.
> * 2.) No Options, Futures, Forex, stuff like that... ONLY Equities that trade on the U.S. Stock Exchange!
> * 3.) If you don't post both the ticker AND the direction (LONG/SHORT) you won't be added to the list of contestants for this week's stock picking challenge!
> * 4.) You cannot duplicate someone's exact play! Either of them! For example- If someone picks AAPL - Long first then you can only pick AAPL - Short (if it has not already been taken yet!) First come, first serve.
> * 5.) Picks MUST be posted in here before the 9:30AM eastern cash market open tomorrow!
> * 6.) You are only allowed 1 leveraged ETF. If you choose two, the second of the two does not count and is still up for grabs. If incorrect picks go un-noticed, you risk your position being forfeited. (These are the 2x/3x ETF's)
> * 7.) Optional - You may post a rationale (either technical or fundamental) for your picks, but it is not mandatory.
> * 8 .) Please **DO NOT EDIT** your picks! If you absolutely must choose another pick, please use a separate post and state that you are changing your original pick to something else!

I will post up the live spreadsheet after the market close tomorrow with everyone's picks, this will include the opening prices, current prices, P&L, and ROI for each of your picks, as well as an overall average ROI between 2 of your picks, and that will be what we will use to total up your 2 picks!

If you guys have any questions please let me know...

Edit: Oh and since we're doing this on Reddit, no one will be able to close out their picks during the week... Everyone's picks will close on Friday.

I think running this contest on /r/StockMarket has the potential to be very successful ... so please don't shy away or feel reluctant in any way to post up some picks in here that you think can do very well!

Let's see what you guys all got for stock picks this week! May the best picker win! lol

Good luck to everyone! Let's see who can deliver the 2 best picks this week!! :)",AAPL,rstockmarket stock picking challenge week 829 92 ok im attempting give one whirl sub see interest community another community im apart contest highly successful also quite competitive folk participate post pick competitive contest get contest kinda similar ughostofgbt asking day different ughostofgbt asking everyone post ticker wanted analyze video would delivering guy btw awesome stuff chris im asking guy post ticker believe perform best week want eligible participate week contest need required 1 post 2 ticker ex aapl apple pick 2 1 2 choose either long short ticker obviously long think go short think go week 3 pick must least 2 minimum contest rule read follow 1 otc foreign company 2 option future forex stuff like equity trade u stock exchange 3 dont post ticker direction longshort wont added list contestant week stock picking challenge 4 duplicate someone exact play either example someone pick aapl long first pick aapl short already taken yet first come first serve 5 pick must posted 930am eastern cash market open tomorrow 6 allowed 1 leveraged etf choose two second two count still grab incorrect pick go unnoticed risk position forfeited 2x3x etf 7 optional may post rationale either technical fundamental pick mandatory 8 please edit pick absolutely must choose another pick please use separate post state changing original pick something else post live spreadsheet market close tomorrow everyones pick include opening price current price pl roi pick well overall average roi 2 pick use total 2 pick guy question please let know edit oh since reddit one able close pick week everyones pick close friday think running contest rstockmarket potential successful please dont shy away feel reluctant way post pick think well let see guy got stock pick week may best picker win lol good luck everyone let see deliver 2 best pick week,Positive,0.9976

[This article on Bloomberg] (http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-09-15/the-chart-that-explains-stock-pickers-422-billion-in-outflows) says that only 9.5% of active managers in large cap beat the S&P 500.  Since the index itself is the average of all the investments, then who or what took all their money and beat the index to average back out to the index?  Was it individual stock pickers?  

*Edit: I can't thank everyone enough for all their thoughtful and insightful comments, perspectives and help.  The answer I like the best here is that essentially active managers this past year made some bad ""off the market"" bets.  My premise was based on an assumption that active managers are exclusively buying and selling stocks, which is incorrect.  Active managers are making all sorts of bets - particularly through derivatives or by holding cash in their portfolio.  It's conjecture, but its seems to be logical to me that managers lost out this past year more than other years.  In addition, there are fees that eat away from returns - not just through active management fees, but also through unexecuted contracts like options.

227,227,2016-09-19,"The SolarCity (SCTY) - Tesla (TSLA) merger might not actually go through... That's according to Wall Street itself, which is pricing SCTY stock at a huge discount to its takeout price. Under the terms of the buyout agreement, SCTY shareholders will receive 0.11 shares of TSLA for each SolarCity share they own. 

The math on that:
TSLA price (9/16 close): $205.40
Implied SCTY takeout price: $22.59 ($205.40 * 0.11)

SCTY price (9/16 close): $17.50.

So, SCTY is trading 23 percent below its takeout price, implying significant uncertainty. There are a few reasons for this, I leave it to you to decide how valid they are, but I just thought this was really interesting and a sort of under-covered topic. 

If you think the deal's gonna close in Q4, now might be a ripe time to load up on SolarCity. On the other hand, it's still dependent on Tesla's stock price, so you need to be somewhat confident that Tesla will remain stable for the next few months. 

Thoughts?

229,229,2016-09-30,"Building Custom Stock Alerts in Google Spreadsheets Hey r/investing,  
&nbsp;  
I used to be a risk analyst at UBS and currently work for a tech company.  My friend is an engineer and MBA also working in tech (ex-Microsoft).  
&nbsp;  
We’re passionate about investing and teaching others about investing. Since we have technical backgrounds, we’re always trying to automate manual tasks.  This has been helpful when searching for and monitoring our investments.  
&nbsp;  
So, we’ve been thinking of creating an online course to teach people how to save time and money by building their own custom stock alerts using Google Sheets. This is something we noticed is a common ask on Reddit.  Although there are great investing resources online, we have found them to be focused on investment theory. However, we haven’t come across much practical content on how to build tools to save investors time and money.  
&nbsp;  
The course will be a *how to* guide for building a spreadsheet to create and manage email and/or SMS alerts for your stocks.  
**We will guide you through the entire process, including:**  
- spreadsheet setup  
- defining the alert logic  
- writing code to get the necessary market data  
- how to send email/sms alerts to yourself  
&nbsp;  
**You’ll learn to create alerts to notify yourself when:**  
- Stock price moves more than $X, or X% from previous day close  
- Stock reaches your target price  
- Trading volume exceeds average daily volume by X%  
&nbsp;  
**You’ll also learn to create reminders for things like:**  
- Ex-Dividend, or Dividend Payout dates  
- Earnings dates  
&nbsp;  
So, we'd like to gauge the community on your interest in such a course.  
**1. Do you find the topics in our proposed syllabus useful?  What would you remove/add?**  
**2. At what price point would this course be way too expensive?  At what price would it be so cheap that it makes you question the course quality?**  
&nbsp;  
Your answers will be very helpful in creating something that people want.  We really appreciate your taking the time to read this.  Feel free to PM me.  Thanks again!  
&nbsp;  
[Edit] If you'd like me to set up a quick price alert for you via email, shoot me a PM and we can do it over the weekend.

236,236,2016-10-07,"A $25bn Snapchat IPO? Look at FB / GOOG's IPO data for insight. Here's the [WSJ story](http://www.wsj.com/articles/snapchat-parent-working-on-ipo-that-could-value-company-at-25-billion-or-more-sources-1475778314) with the following figures:

|Snapchat|2015A|2016E|2017E|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $60m | $250-350m | ~$1bn |

## GOOG

So what did Google look like in it's early years?

|Google|1999A|2000A|2001A|2002A|2003A|2004A|2005A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $0m | $19m | $86m | $440m | $1,466m|$3,189m | $6,139m|

The IPO was in August 2004. It was values at $23bn in the IPO.

## FB

Next let's look at Facebook, whose IPO was in May 2012 valuing the business at $81bn

|Facebook|2009A|2010A|2011A|2012A|2013A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $777m | $1,974m | $3,711m | $5,089m | $7,872m|

## Well?

Both Facebook and Google were profitable at the time of their IPOs and they had shown an acceleration in their revenue growth. This got them 5 to 10x next year's forecast revenue, and 7 to 16x current year's forecast revenue. 

For me the key is proof that the topline in accelerating. Google's top line accelerated every year until the great recession. Facebook's stopped immediately after the IPO, crashing the stock, until the topline started ramping again in 2013.

## A Rocket or Rock?

If Snapchat's sales follow this path, then a $25bn will be a steal. If not, it'll be another Twitter.

|Snapchat|2015A|2016E|2017E|2018E|2019E|2020E|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $60m | $300m | $1bn |$2bn |$3.5bn |$6bn |




## EDIT:

If you're curious on the stats for Twitter, it IPOed in Nov 2013. It's sales had been accelerating. The business was valued at $14bn, i.e. 10x the forecast year's sales.

|Twitter|2010A|2011A|2012A|2013A|2014A|2015A|

I don't care what your opinion of my credentials are, I care about your opinion on the subject at hand. It's pathetic that the second most upvoted comment in this thread is an ad hominem argument about my age/the fact that I didn't take a certain exam. I hate to feed into this stereotype and reference The Big Short, but among the guys that predicted the housing bubble in 2007 were a medical doctor and two kids in a garage. It doesn't take a rocket scientist if you read the articles.

I originally wrote this as a facebook post for my friends. Please excuse the entry-level explanations, we all know how the bond market works here, but I'm at work and don't really have time to modify it right now. This was also written last Thursday, treasuries have moved even higher still since then.

It is important to begin this breakdown with the notion that the stock market as you know it has been fraudulently inflated since 1982. The Reagan Administration, in their ever-prescient wisdom, enacted SEC Rule 10b-18, creating a safe harbor whereby corporations could buy back their own stocks. This effectively legalized price manipulation, but worry not! They set a limit on the amount of money these firms could spend… at 25% of the average daily trading volume PER DAY. This rule overrode the anti-fraud measures enacted in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and set the market off on the 34-year bull run that people love to cite when they say that the market is “doing just fine.” The chairwoman of the SEC has admitted that they aren’t even monitoring this rule, but that is beside the point, as it is a ridiculous rule to begin with. Long story short, the record setting DJIA quotes that we constantly see are no more than a product of price manipulation and financial engineering.

Here are a few facts:

1) Stock buybacks have accounted for a little over one fifth of the buildup of S&P 500 market capitalization since the 2009 crash. ([source](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/how-stock-buybacks-have-become-wall-streets-new-drug-2015-07-17))

2) In 2015Q1, firms’ shareholder cash distributions (buybacks + dividend payments) exceeded their net income for the first time in a non-recession year EVER. ([source](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-26/s-p-500-spending-on-buybacks-dividends-exceeds-operating-profit))

3) While companies are sitting on record-setting cash piles, they have been issuing bonds to borrow money to finance these distributions, since they cannot repatriate the money they have hidden in offshore tax havens. ([source](http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2013/04/30/with-all-of-apples-cash-why-is-it-issuing-bonds/))

It is that third point where President-Elect Donald J. Trump becomes relevant. His proposed tax plan would create a $6.2 trillion budget shortfall over the first ten years it was enacted according to the Tax Policy Center ([source](http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/analysis-donald-trumps-revised-tax-plan)). To cover this shortfall, as the government does when public revenues do not meet public expenditures, there will need to be a bond issuance and increase in national debt. This is just the baseline, and does not account for increases in expenditure to repair infrastructure as he spoke about in his victory speech, nor does it include expenditures on “the wall” that Mexico said on Tuesday that they will not be paying for. That already high number is only likely to increase.

This is where economics come into play. When the US government issues bonds, they increase the supply of bonds available for purchase in the marketplace. As with any “good” (a term loosely applied to a financial instrument here), the mechanics of supply and demand dictate that the price of US treasury bonds will fall as their supply increases under constant demand. Because of the way that bond yields are computed, this will drive up the interest rate that US treasuries pay out. For those of you that don’t know, the interest rate paid out by a US treasury bond is referred to as the “risk-free” rate of interest, and it is the rate on which other interest rates are based. This is a fundamental rule of economics and of the credit market. An increase in the risk-free rate will undoubtedly lead to an increase in the ultra-low rates that firms have been borrowing at since 2007 when the Federal Reserve Bank instituted their near-zero interest rate policy. When the cheap credit dries up, it will no longer be economically viable for firms to leverage buybacks on bond issues.

The rising interest rates have an added effect of decreasing demand for stocks. As investors are enticed to flock into treasuries and other bonds for their new, higher yield, their demand for equity investments will fall. This means that the companies that were already accounting for almost 20% of the trading volume on the NYSE by dollar amount will have to spend even MORE money on buying back their own stocks to continue to perpetuate the massive fraud that has been going on since before most of us were born. This increased demand for debt will lead them to issue more bonds which, as we discussed earlier, will only serve to push the interest rate even higher and make the system more unsustainable. When firms cannot efficiently borrow money to finance their price manipulation operations, and a fifth of the demand for equities rapidly disappears, the stock market as we know it will fall apart.

This is why I am scared of Donald Trump. Not because he is a racist, not because he is a misogynist, and not because he has outstanding allegations of child rape and fraud against him. It is his hubris and ignorance to the fundamental laws that govern the functioning of our financial markets (despite his claims to be a “terrific” business man) that scares me the most. You can deport anybody you want, grab whoever’s pussy you want to grab, and rail against any faith you choose, but you cannot implement such a drastic tax proposal and such grandiose public expenditures without collapsing the United States’ (and thus that of most of the world, by ripple effect) equity market.

If you made it this far, congratulations! Now it’s time to answer a few questions that some confused people have been asking me lately.

1) If Donald Trump is so bad for the economy, why is the Dow Jones up? Well friend, I’m sorry to burst your bubble but the DJIA is not the only indicator of a robust and healthy economy. I think this is a result of firms getting in as many buybacks as they can before rates go up, but I could be wrong on that. Take a look at the yield on a 10-year US treasury bond, which is up over 25 basis points from its pre-election level. This means that a lot of smart people who manage a lot of money are scared of what rates will look like in the future, and are selling off their bond holdings. The futures market (a more complicated system that I don’t have time to explain right now without typing an entire other diatribe just like this) for treasuries looks even more grim, down almost 2% since the election.

2) What other impacts could this have outside of the stock market? If you have an adjustable rate mortgage or student loan, now is the time to refinance. Check your cardmember agreements for credit cards, and any auto finance agreements you may have as well.

3) Why didn’t you say anything before the election? I knew this bubble was inflating for a long time, but foresaw it bursting in 2018 when the rest of the market believed that the FRB would hike interest rates. I (along with most other economists) did not foresee what a massive and expedient impact that electing Donald Trump would have on rates, nor was the likelihood of a Trump presidency believed to be that high.

http://smartstocknews.com/29602-microsoft-corporation-msft-gains-eu-antitrust-approval-to-acquire-linkedin-corp-lnkd  
Does that seem fair?  
InkdIn has one of the highest P/E ratios I've ever seen (some my disagree, but I think that P/E is an appropriate way to evaluate risk).  
So I'm curious what MSFT hopes to gain by acquiring LNKD.  
If it's just the userbase then MSFT is paying $56 per user, is that really worth it?  
$26,000,000,000 / 460,000,000 users = ~56 dollars / user.  
I've also seen some sites say MSFT wants LNKD's ""recruitment services"", again I don't see how this helps them.  
I like LinkedIn, but I wouldn't pay $26,000,000,000 for it, why would Microsoft?  

**edit:**  
If Microsoft just wanted to diversify... WHY DIDN'T THEY COMPETE WITH VERIZON FOR YAHOO?  
Verizon got Yahoo for just under $5B.
http://money.cnn.com/2016/07/25/technology/yahoo-verizon-deal-sale
Yahoo does all kinds of stuff. AND they have Tumblr, which in my opinion, is a more successful Social-media app then LinkedIn by far.  
.  
**Edit 2:**  
So I asked the CFO of the company I work for (business major) and he said this...  
>They're an enterprise software provider, and they're buying a social media site that decision makers for their target customers use constantly for business purposes. They'll probably integrate with their own platforms (one drive, new slack clone) to create a whole ecosystem for themselves focused on enterprise social media. They overpaid though.  
They're probably going to turn it into a salesforce competitor, the problem with the price they paid is that no one else would have offered that much

So it sounds like Microsoft has some sort of long term goal, like they're trying to create their own ""full ecosystem"", and this was a very expensive step toward that goal.  
The acquisition still doesn't make sense to me though (like when Facebook bought Oculus to for 2B).   
I truly feel like there's something else at play here, beyond Taxes.  
.  
*Edit 3:**  
>Your CEO is not very well informed, sorry to say. First, the price they paid may be too much, but that is not something that can be said without doing a proper analysis of the company's fundamentals. The company was trading at that price just a few months earlier so saying that they overpaid and therefore the whole market is wrong about Linkedin's price before doing your due dil is a bit presumtuous. Second, Microsoft already has a salesforce competitor, called Dynamics CRM. If framed around the CRM business, the linkedin acquisition makes a lot of sense as it help differentiate Microsoft's offering while at the same time keeps Salesforce from having it. Microsoft has the ecosystem advantage (office 365, azure, dynamics) but this can only go so far if salesforce gets too far ahead with their offering (they are already the clear leaders). Third, I personally think that Satya Nadella is the ultimate CEO and the best one for Microsoft, so I am ready to give him the beneift of the doubt on this one, your boss should probably do the same. I really doubt Satya didn't study this acquisition thoroughly before giving it the go ahead.  

/u/oblivision

I know there are many $TSLA fans around here, however I do not understand for people rooting against this company. They are trying to employ locally, create products that are more environmentally friendly and develop new technologies that we can benefit from. I have always found solar stocks too much of a gamble to buy, however I see the SCTY merger being good for Tesla. Some parts of the world seem like a no brainier to have the new solar roofs installed. While solar energy is still a very small percentage of the market share (2%), I believe the rate at which it will increase over the next decade will be large. I also believe that they have the right idea in trying to make their product user friendly and aesthetically pleasing, which hopefully will market well to both builders and home owners.
I bought into Tesla at 180$ and will continue to hold. Have I drank too much of the Koolaid?

255,255,2017-01-19,"Tesla Upgraded by Morgan Stanley - enjoy the short squeeze http://www.cnbc.com/2017/01/19/morgan-stanley-upgrades-tesla-giving-4-reasons.html

Price target: $305 by Q4 2017. 

Shares are up ~4% in pre-market on this news. 

Morgan Stanley is the first investment bank to upgrade Tesla this year. I expect many banks to do the same as the Model 3 is launching by H2 2017. 

Of course, there is the possibility that Tesla may delay the release of the Model 3, which may prevent it from reaching Morgan Stanley's current Q4 target price of $305. 

However, I doubt that the Model 3 will be delayed any further than Q1 2018, and that is a conservative estimate. I really do think Tesla will get its act together and deliver the Model 3 on time (with a 5% margin of error which translates to +/- a few weeks). 

In the extra long-term, I expect Tesla to reach $500+. It is a ""bubble stock"", and just like how investors played Amazon back a few years ago, I expect the same thing to happen to Tesla. 

Tesla may look overpriced, but it's more than just an auto company. It is an energy solutions company that is transforming both the auto and energy industries all in one-shot. It's very different from investing in traditional auto companies like GM, which offer good value, a dividend but much lower potential growth. 

GM may be rolling out electric cars, but it is years behind Tesla in terms of charging networks and AI. And before you say that other automakers are on-track to manufacture self-driving cars for cheaper with the same quality, remember Tesla is not just an auto company, it is a energy solutions company that is propagating the next revolution in TWO industries, not just one. 

*EDIT:* The Tesla Model S and X are niche products. They are high-end, large sedan/SUV luxury vehicles, more expensive than most BMW, Lexus, Infiniti, etc models.

The Model 3, while still relatively more expensive than your traditional value-for-money Korean/Japanese small-medium sedan, attracts a far, far greater amount of potential customers, which, in my opinion (and many experts' opinions), will lead to an explosion in TSLA's stock price through the $400 region, and potentially even $500~$600 (i.e. where Amazon was 2 years ago). 

*EDIT 2:* TSLA stock is very much following the footsteps of AMZN stock. Look at AMZN's stock price between November 2013 to March 2015. It was mostly a sideways movement, with periodic uptrends and downtrends. The same thing has been happening to TSLA for the past 3 years. However, as a big change is coming to Tesla (i.e. the Model 3 launch and mass production of energy storage products), I expect this recent boom in the stock price to continue an uptrend for the next year, at the very least. And I expect TSLA's stock price to reach $400~$600 in this latest uptrend. Again, this is just my opinion, but I have been correct with many of my stock decisions in the past. This includes RSX and RSXJ, which I claimed earlier, in early December, that I saw limited gains in those Russian ETFs. And that actually happened.

260,260,2017-01-28,"Stock Analysis: Apple (AAPL) **Company Overview**

Short version: They make iPhones.

 Long version: Apple Inc designs, manufactures, & markets mobile communication & media devices, personal computers, & portable digital music players, & sells a variety of related software, services, accessories, networking solutions, & third-party digital content. (Morningstar.com)                

**Note: All numbers come from Apple’s financial reports and probably are not completely up to date, but they more or less get the jist of it

**Bull Case (Catalysts)**
1. Apple is selling at a p/e of just under 15 (open for interpretation, see bear case) thus at least we can say it is at least reasonably valued. The main short term catalyst for the stock is the cash on its balance sheet. Apple has just over $230B of cash and $70B of debt. Even after subtracting debt from cash, they have about $160B in cash. Why does this matter? Imagine finding a stock that you think is reasonably valued at a p/e of 12 (on p/e alone you might buy it). But then you find out that it also comes with $4 cash/share. That comes like a bonus and it essentially makes the stock $4/share more valuable (intrinsically). But the problem is that over 90% of the cash is overseas. The good news is that Trump has promised to allow for repatriation of overseas cash at a low tax rate. Apple has approximately $43/share (or $30/share minus debt) in cash.

2. The iPhone 8. The bulls say that the 10 year anniversary rendition of the iPhone will be amazing and cause a super cycle where earnings grow dramatically again. 

**Bear Case (Industry headwinds)**

1. Apple is selling at a p/e of over 14, thus at least we can say it is at least not incredibly undervalued. The main issue is that about 63% (*edit thank you /u/JustAsIgnorantAsYou it is not 90%) of their revenues come from the iPhone. Apple has seen smartphone sales drop year over year and it is not inconceivable for this to be a continuing trend. Apple’s phones are pricey and the cheaper competition’s phones are getting better (no matter how much I hate Android…). In my opinion (and I’m an iPhone user) the future will have even less people willing to pay a substantial premium for a higher quality smartphone, instead more people will just choose the cheapest price (they’ll all be comparable anyways).


**Conclusion**

Apple faces industry headwinds of margin deterioration. Apple bulls would argue either one of two things: the declining iPhone demand is over-exaggerated and that the bears are not pricing in anything else that’s in the pipeline. The bears argue that - no, it really is that bad. Whether or not one makes an investment in Apple would depend on their views on these issues, as well as trying to factor in the potential short term catalysts in repatriation of overseas cash as well as the iPhone 8.

I've been fighting the temptation to buy back in lately, but every time I get back online the price has risen. What do you think? Just keep my earnings and take this as a lesson, or maybe consider buying back in?

Apple does have a lot going for them in the near future, but it will cost me $864 to buy back in and I'd have to hope the price continues to skyrocket at least as much as it has since I sold. I'm leaning on not doing it but I'm interested in your opinions.",AAPL,buy back aapl bought apple stock back college like 2008 2009 split 36 share well made thousand initial 700 investment im idiot research selling sold right last quarterly report read article iphone 7 poorly also didnt like headphone jack idea kinda like sold 115 since ive watched stock rise nearly 139 poor decision lost potential extra 864 life changer hurt pride ive fighting temptation buy back lately every time get back online price risen think keep earnings take lesson maybe consider buying back apple lot going near future cost 864 buy back id hope price continues skyrocket least much since sold im leaning im interested opinion,Positive,0.2823

A Securities and Exchange Commission filing shows that ValueAct boosted its stake to 5.2 percent from 4.4 percent, although its holdings are only a fraction of what it once held in the company. ValueAct has owned varying amounts of Valeant shares since 2006.

283,283,2017-04-17,"Tesla ($TSLA) Units, Revenue, and Stock Price projection thru 2025 Over the last three years I posted two models that attempted to look into the future of Tesla and the correlating price.

I've updated the sheet to include all the different changes/events that have happened in the last 3 years to come up with a more inclusive (and complete) projection of TSLA thru 2025 based on the latest guidance from the company. To summarize:

* Tesla is guiding for 500k car units sold in 2018, 1m by 2020 (model reflects a more conservative approach at 80% of guidance).
* Since 3 years ago along with its purchase of Solar City, Tesla has announced new vehicles and products that it will be adding to its catalog. Including Model 3 (mid-size $35k sedan), these are Model Y (mid-size SUV), a Pick Up truck, a Semi Truck, a ""Mini Bus"", a solar roof, solar panels, battery storage, and a ride sharing business. All of these can be found in Tesla's [Master Plan, Part Deux post](https://www.tesla.com/blog/master-plan-part-deux).
* Tesla is projecting its Energy division to be as large as its car/transportation division, with an S curve growth (i.e. exponential) in the coming months.

Based on these, I've create a yearly chart of my projected units sold by category, revenue, and expected GM%. Quick note:

* I'm projecting the Tesla Freight (semi truck) and Bus to be a service model, not one where companies are expected to purchase the truck or bus outright (i.e. Tesla becomes a 3PL provider with fully autonomous trucks). I've modeled these on 100% margin on an expected profit amount that I think they'll be able to draw from each unit on a yearly basis.
* I have no idea what the per-unit price of the storage business extrapolates to, so I attempted to model it based on a % of total business. Don't pay too much attention to the unit figures under the storage business.

I'm setting a price target of $733 using 2021 figure for revenue of $91.7bn. You can use this same exercise for any of the figures on the model (i.e. if you want to assuming price based on 2025 revenue, you can apply the same math above to arrive at a stock price). I'm assuming the following:

* 10% EBITDA to Revenue ratio based on guidance from Elon Musk on one of their 2015 earnings calls. I'm using this to remove the assumption that Tesla will forever be in maximum growth mode (i.e. reinvesting all profits back into the company)
* A P/E ratio of 15
* 20% discount based on risks (Model 3 launch, macro environment, etc.)

Back in December 2000, my grandmother and grandfather bought me 5 shares of apple.

Recently, my Grandmother passed, and it was in her will, that the 5 apple shares would be released. I talked to my grandfather, and he said that the 5 shares are worth about $750 and I would be receiving that in the next week.

I remember a few years ago, checking the price of apple stock (to see what my 5 shares were worth) and I remember it being well over $1000, if not like $3000 for all 5 shares... (I forget what the price per share was, but I thought it was something like $600+ PER SHARE?!?)

Why is worth $750 today? I thought the price has only gone higher... I was kind of shocked to hear I was only receiving $750 from Apple stock they bought in 2000.

My grandfather also asked if I would want the 5 shares or just the cash from the shares.  I don't want to make a big mistake here.

The S&P 500 average is 25, and the P/E ratio of similar large cap firms such as $AMZN (193) and $GOOG (32) shows that premiums are to be paid for solid companies with a large grasp of market share.

The iPhone 8 is coming out soon and even though the 7 was garbage the stock flew on positive sales beating expectations. I believe the same will happen with the 8, but even more. Apple is going to be a leader in AI going forward, and Elon Musk has said in the past that Apple is going to be the biggest competitor in self driving cars to Tesla. Also, with Trump's plans for repatriation Apple could benefit greatly as they currently have billions overseas. Last but not least, Apple has over 23B in free cash flow, and Tim Cook is one of the best CEO's in the entire world. They will make the right, smart decisions going forward and now is the time to get in prior to earnings. Unless you have no girth, then wait until after earnings and hop aboard the Apple train.

The original content NFLX is throwing out is ridiculous. 

i.e., Orange is the new black, New Marvel Shows, 13 Reasons Why, Narcos, Stranger Things.

I'm pretty much making a bet with the Millennials. Every time a show like the above comes out it seems to blow up in social media, and by blow up I mean REALLY blow up. It's everywhere!

293,293,2017-05-23,"Comparing the P/E of Alphabet(google) and every other company that's not Alphabet I am stunned when I see Alphabets P/E; with the endless moon shots and infinite bank account, stellar growth, and growth potential I would have thought Alphabet would be priced for its potential growth like so many companies that aren't even close to Alphabet, or as likely to hit big on their moonshots. 

But I see companies with astronomically higher P/E ratios compared to Alphabet. Amazon's roughly 180 and I think it can be argued it is justified. But even other companies that have the same P/E as google don't even compare to google's potential, Red Robin Gourmet Burgers has a PE OF 110... Netflix 206... Scott's Miracle Grow company has a higher PE then Alphabet at 37... how is this possible? how can someone justify buying this burger restaurant, video streaming service, lawn care company and thousands of other companies with similar PE ratios and even greater PE ratios over a monopoly search engine that buys, invests in, or just creates a new division when it wants to try a new potential life changing technology?

I personally believe Alphabets self driving car division alone, Waymo, is justification enough to have the PE be at least double. Which is why I bought a sizable sum of Goog recently(sizable for me).

I appreciate any insight in to why anybody would buy anything but this monopoly.

294,294,2017-05-23,"Engineer here: this is how you analyze GOOG as a quant A few weeks ago I started trying to find undervalued companies and invest in them. This lead me to two stocks $GBX and $CTB. Well, $CTB and value investing in general turned out to be a huge turd so I *liquidated my position*. This freed up some cash to try new ideas. 

I've decided to switch from value investing to becoming a quant. Now from what I can tell, the details are scarce, quants do a lot of statistics calculations on stocks. As a learning exercise I used google sheets to analyze a stock everyone loves: $GOOG.

Here is the [spreadsheet] (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vJFb-DXU68phDNs3kVzpyGupHTFs_zgaxqzrcikCPrI/) where I calculate some commonly used statistic functions manually and compare it with the excel result. I wouldn't be a good engineer if the results weren't checked to be exactly the same.

These are the quantities computed:

* mean 843.0914433
* standard deviation 42.96703245
* covariance (to S&P500) 1366.739769
* correlation (to S&P500) 0.7318863498

Then a few hours later, the price and chart disappeared altogether from that particular way of searching. 

The reason I suspect that Google did something is because I normally keep a tab open on Google to view Snap's stock price, which I have followed since the beginning. Then the article came out this morning, then the keywords stopped working for showing the chart price. First changing dollars to euroes to make it look like the stock dropped rather than jump like it did, then disappearing from the search. I'm sure it's still there, only that the keyword search makes Snap's price difficult to find now.

I love Netflix, it's a great product. No way in hell is the company worth 78b. NFLX did 8.83b in revenue last year with a sub count of 94m. So everyone of those 94m subs contributes about $94 to revenue. Todd Juenger is a super bullish analyst from Bernstein who says subs could hit 300m in 2030. Even if this is true, 300m subs = 28-29b in revenue. Let's be nice to NFLX and assume they can squeeze a little more money out of their sub base and let's push the revenue contribution per sub number from $94 each to $110 each puts us at revenue around 33b. Net Income/Sales for NFLX is 4%ish, NFLX will get better at controlling costs as it matures as a business, I don't doubt this at all so let's say in 13 years the company manages to get to NI/Sales of around 12%. 33b in revenue, NI/Sales of 12% = 3.96b in net income. Market cap today is 78b, and NFLX ""might"" be able to hit 4b in NI in 13 years. So if the stock doesn't go up 1 penny from now until 2030 it'll be trading at a P/E of 19. Which is a pretty reasonable P/E ratio for a mature company, but the stock has to do nothing for the next 13 years to get there. This company needs to hit a NI/Sales of 40% one day to justify it's valuation. The only way you can buy this stock is if you think NFLX can triple it's subscriber base while keeping costs completely flat for the next 13 years. That doesn't seem likely.

Killed it today. Nice 20% jump on my calls. God I love microsoft, such a stable and easy stock to do calls on.

Who else riding this one through ER?


---------------------------------------------

Also as a person who is a professional in IT (as a consultant/deployment/support specalist to many different companies/clients). I cant recommend Microsoft enough. They are doing big things in the cloud department. Amazon had its lead because it started cloud infrastructure services first but Azure and O365 are and always will be (going forward) industry standards since most IT professionals are Microsoft specialists and most companies utilize mostly Microsoft services. Companies in droves literally contact my company to get quotes on implementations of Microsoft cloud services. And each year we are getting more and more without even having to cold sell the product to companies first.

For them to start cornering the cloud market and having people pay them monthly for running hardware on data centres is HUGE. Now you wont just be paying Microsoft for licenses to use their operation systems and softwares/services but also paying them for upkeeping hardware, security & data. Get VERY long calls and dont even sell it until you hit expiry. You will end up with massive gains as their cloud services gets a larger foothold, month by month.


---------------------------------------------

Even companies that are non profit companies will opt for O365. Non profits get a MASSIVE discount! 

- E1 license = free (CAD)

- E3 license = $5 (CAD)

Now compare those prices to the actual costs: 

- E1 license costs $9.70 (CAD) 

- E3 license cost $25.30 (CAD). 

I want to stress that these licenses are monthly per user. Which means that companies that opt in for Office 365 will not ride their servers past warranty expiry... but rather be paying endlessly on a monthly basis.... to Microsoft... (Not dell, HP or other hardware providers). This is TOTAL takeover of IT by microsoft(From servers to service.)

---------------------------------------------

Think amazon's AWS is the real deal? Go on linkedin and type ""AWS"" and see how many jobs come up in your city. Then type O365 and/or azure and see how many pop up. Thats all you need to know. Its not that I dont like AWS, its also an amazing service that I love to use. However the thing is, AWS is an alien product for companies and IT professionals, which makes it harder to them to head in amazon's direction regardless of how robust and easy to use it actually is. 

---------------------------------------------

On premise servers are being phased out for many reasons. Biggest reason: not having to self manage. Which historically meant that...

+ you had to pay for maintenance
+ make sure its uptime is almost 100%
+ salary for additional IT staff
+ Purchase servers
+ Provide security
+ electricity(not cheap)
+ require a server room that is highly secure
+ Must have redundancy of the servers (sometimes having 2 servers for the same role)
+ Doing back ups
+ Following/auditing compliance (ask any IT professional how much of a pain this shit is)
+ Paying for additional support for the servers (Racks, peripheral, etc). 

All of this is being phased out and being managed at large data centers supported by the best in the business. Its a huge sign of relief for executives who now never have to worry about any of these things.

I tried to pick stocks that have consistently raised dividends and have had somewhat low volatility. (Apple aside lol)

&nbsp;


**1 - Apple**

* Fan of apple products or not, we are all familiar with their products

* This is a must own stock in a well-diversified portfolio
* Obsessed with returning cash to investors through buybacks and dividend increases

Dividend Yield = 1.44%

1 Year Returns = 49.63%

5 Year Returns = 131.1%

P/E Ratio = 19.05 (low for tech stock)

Strong customer base = Printing money making them potentially the first $1T company ever


&nbsp;
    

**2 - VISA**

* Almost the definition of a “blue chip” stock

* 1 of the most 15 valuable companies in the world, has huge market share, it is highly profitable with huge barriers to entry

* Global market share leader in credit cards with over 323M active accounts compared to master card’s 191M

Dividend Yield = .69% 

1 year = 43.4%

5 year = 190.43%

Great stock with a steady track record of growth


&nbsp;


**3 - Texas Instruments**

* TI has been around since 1930, and is a $100B Company today

* Still growing at a healthy rate - revenue is expected to increase 11.8% in 2018

* They are a leading supplier in a rapidly transforming automotive and industrial sectors

* Raised dividend for a consecutively for 13 years

* They’ve also focused on buying back shares to decrease dilution. In 2004 there were 1.77B outstanding shares, 2017 = 1B

Dividend Yield = 2.38%

1 year = 40.9%

5 year = 218.1%

Few other stocks offer this kind of dividend with such opportunity for growth

&nbsp;


**4 - Johnson & Johnson**

* Arguably one of the most diversified and consistent stocks available today

* They’ve raised dividends 54 years in a row, making this a long term pillar of any portfolio

* J&J has sustained reliable growth through diversification, management, and acquisitions of competitors

Div Yield = 2.38%

1 year = 21.8%

5 year = 99.1%

Slow and steady wins the race


&nbsp;


**5 - Microsoft**

* I personally work for one of the biggest MSFT resellers in the Midwest
Huge margins in a lot of their biggest service areas (cloud, ERP, O365)

* Msft is incentivizing their salespeople to sell cloud

* They are consistently raising dividends

Div Yield = 1.96%

1 Year = 35.2%

5 Year = 224.79%

352,352,2018-02-11,"Fundamental Analysis; Alphabet Inc $GOOGL Hello /r/stockmarket!

Even in these tough times, I keep chopping away at the research and analysis that I always do. Today's write-up is about Alphabet Inc, more commonly known as the parent company of Google (Ticker: $GOOGL). As always, this is my own fundamental analysis, and the write-up that follows. I employ trend research and discounted cash flow analysis, and it is fully up to you if you want to take anything here written as fact. Numbers and information is taken from the 4th quarter of 2017 and earlier. That said, here is my view of Alphabet Inc.
__________
**The company**  
Alphabet is an holding and parent company of many subsidiaries, focusing on technology. What kind of technology you ask? Well, a ton of it. Here is a list of some of the subsidiaries that Alphabet has under its massive technological wing:

* Google, an internet company focusing on it’s famous search engine, advertising business and video service through Youtube. It goes without saying that Google is by far the largest and most profitable of Alphabets businesses.
* Calico, a R&D biotech company
* Chronicle, a cybersecurity and anti-hacking company
* Dandelion, a geothermal energy startup company.
* DeepMind, an Artificial intelligence company
* GV (Google venture), a strategic investment company
* CapitalG (Google Capital), a profit-directed investment company
* Google fiber, a developer for fiber networking and an ISP 
* Nest Labs, a home automation company. Develops programmable home appliances. 
* Jigsaw (Google Ideas), a tech incubator company, focusing on unique technology
* Sidewalk labs, urban innovation company, developer within infrastructure and urban technology.
*  Verily (Google X), life-science research and development company
* Waymo, world leading company in autonomous driving

As you can see, the list of technological focuses is incredibly broad. Alphabet is an ad company that puts all its profits into developing thousands of products to revolutionize the future.

  __________

**Fundamentals & Forecasts**   
Alphabet has a annual revenue of $110,8 billion, resulting in a gross profit of $66,5 billion and a net profit (earnings) of $13,9 billion. That is an 24% increase in revenue year to year (y/y). Alphabets numbers are slightly jumbled up recently as this quarter, like many other tech giants in the US following the tax reform of the new year, moved huge amount of international profits into the US. This resulted in alphabets tax rate for Q4 2017 to become 138% of their pre-tax income. We have to adjust for this one time payment, as Alphabet moves that money into the country to invest in their capital expenditure and R&D. The company has a historical tax rate of roughly 18-19%, which is very low. Also of note, Alphabet has during the last 2 years fairly consistently increased their R&D spending by 20% y/y each quarter, really highlighting how the company is putting more and more money into their technology R&D. Their general operating margin is roughly 60%, which is also very high, but not uncommon in the ad market. A last notion to mention is that Alphabet is after their intake of additional saved up international cash very net cash positive, with a war chest of $97 billion. As a huge part of Alphabet is founding its own startups, acquiring other startups that have potential and investing in either one, their huge war chest is a very strong advantage for them to have. 

Alphabet is huge. It’s enormous. This makes forecasting complicated as they can have huge swings if their profitability goes down, and it could be very hard to recover. I preface the next message with this, so you as a reader is aware. Alphabet right now has amazing fundamentals. The company is incredibly strong. They have the historical income numbers of a growth company, while being profitable and stable. These are facts that make Alphabet very fundamentally sound.

 If we assume that Alphabet reached their growth peak in 2017, and from there have a steady growth slowdown until they run into a complete growth-stop in 2030, as well as maintained tax rate (20%), gross (& operating) margin (60% respective 23%), we still see upside in its current price. These calculations were done at a -3% maturity rate, along with a discount rate of 7%. These are fairly standard industry numbers. Using this pessimistic view of the company in my eyes, seeing no further improvement, the net present stock value would end up at $1199, a valuation upside of 15% after the recent drop. The more realistic scenario is the same, except that we maintain the current growth for the coming year, and then seeing a slower maturity drop until the growth-stop, we see an 34% upside, $1402. 

  __________


**Concerns & Risk**  
The recent discussions about Alphabet is its issues with TAC, traffic acquisition cost. That is the cost that Alphabet pays to get traffic to their services, where the expense is increasing and margins decreasing fairly rapidly. At the beginning of 2016, the ad revenue of $18 million was hurt by a TAC of $3.7 million, which is an TAC cost of sale of 21% of the ad revenue. These numbers increased to $21.4 million, $4.63 million and 21.6% respectively. Now, at the end of 2017, the TAC expense grows 11.5% faster than the ad revenue. This is clearly a problem for Google as a service, and as their margins fall, this causes real concern about their profitability. If we apply a lowering margin down from a VERY consistent 60% gross margin after cost of sales, down 1% per year down to 53%, we see the net present evaluation drop to 946 per share, a -10% downside. This is a real risk, and is the scenario where Google slowly loses its iron grasp on the ad industry. The very realistic scenario, the middle ground, is where Alphabets margins drop from their consistent 60%, to 56% by 2020. 56% gross margin was what happened this last quarter, Q417, which caused the 10% drop in value along with uncertainties in the overall market. If Alphabet never recovers from this drop in margin, their current valuation is fair. If they recover but slowly struggle down to 56% again, even slowly down to 53%,  they have a very slight downside. As you can see, this is a potential problem for Google. It is worth pointing out that this drop is very abrupt, a blip, and is no proof of any sort of a trend. A similar company, Facebook $FB, has a gross margin of 87%, which shows that higher margins is also attainable.

  __________


**My view**  
Alphabet has been my personal favorite company since I became an adult, which makes me slightly biased. I am happy to report that my financial knowledge tells me that they also deserve the praise I give them personally. The company is amazing, attaining growth numbers that shouldn’t happen to large businesses like this. Most analysts are right to worry about the recent decline in gross margins, but if these are improved, they should be a catalyst that removes the sliver of doubt that is the only thing holding Alphabets price down. I will most certainly hold Alphabet through that. It is such a diverse business, deep into the future of tech, supported by the greatest ad company this world have ever seen. They are regulated hard to leave their main product, Google search engine, unbiased as if they were greedy with it, could dominate any market. That power is impossible to put a $ on.

I personally believe that Google is a perfect buying opportunity for a very long term investment. They will get their margins back on track, their excellent management fully understand this. It might not be the next quarter, it might not be the quarter after that. However, if we assume that their operating margins look very realistic, bordering pessimistic, and that they recover their margin issue over the next 4 years, their net present stock value is $1236, a 18% upside. This doesn’t make Alphabet a snap purchase, but it makes them a fair purchase. When you buy Alphabet you buy a sliver of the future. They have their hand in every single futuristic technology, everything from Biotech to AI and self-driving cars, to VR/AR to the internet of things. They are industry leaders in all of these (barring biotech, tough industry). When these markets become profitable in the future, your good purchase of Alphabet today becomes an excellent hedge into the R&D of the future.

I bought Alphabet right before the drop of 10%. My only mistake is that I did not buy more. However, it turned out fine since it tanked. I am happy people doubt their margins because WHEN they recover, I will own a lot more Alphabet than I would have without the drop. 

Thanks for reading

Netflix has over 3 times more active users compared to Hulu, meaning there is more room for Hulu to grow than Netflix. $DIS now has the ability to optimize Hulu and stream their original content on the streaming platform, which should lead to greater future growth.

Netflix Could Be Hero for Weary Tech Investors Needing Spark.
If there’s anything left with the potential to cheer up technology investors, it’s an earnings report from Netflix Inc.

Through an onslaught of market swoons, privacy scandals and antitrust threats, the Los Gatos, California-based television and movie service has stood unscathed. More than that: the stock just had its best quarter since 2015, while companies like Alphabet Inc. and Facebook Inc. lost ground.

“Netflix earnings can not come soon enough,” Daniel Ives, chief strategy officer for GBH Insights LLC, said in an interview. “This is a key earnings season, especially given some of the macro and political uncertainty and regulatory worries.”

The company’s earnings report on Monday is the first of the tech megacaps -- and it comes at a critical time. After four selloffs of 3 percent or more this year, the S&P 500 Information Technology Index is trading just above the halfway mark between the March 12 record and the 2018 low on Feb. 8. 

Alphabet and Facebook, which report on April 23 and April 25, are both in the red for the year. Apple Inc. reports on May 1 and has gained 3 percent.

Enter Netflix, which has shot up faster than analysts can raise their price targets. The stock has added more than $50 billion in market value in 2018 and traded above the average price forecast for most of the past three months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. 

The shares rose as much as 2.7 percent Friday, their fifth consecutive gain, after Deutsche Bank raised its rating to buy and Comcast said it will add Netflix subscriptions to its cable packages.

The average estimate for Netflix’s first quarter revenue has increased by about $163 million to $3.69 billion after a blowout fourth quarter in January, according to Bloomberg data. Higher expectations combined with recent stock gains leave little room for error for Netflix, which is the second-best performing stock in the S&P 500 this year after Nektar Therapeutics, which only joined the benchmark index a few weeks ago.

Wall Street is looking for first quarter total subscriber net additions of 1.45 million in the U.S. and 5.0 million internationally, according to the average of six estimates compiled by Bloomberg News. That compares with the company’s forecasts of 1.45 million and 4.9 million on Jan. 22. Deutsche Bank, in its upgrade, said Netflix may have added up to 1 million more subscribers globally in the first quarter than forecast.

“The market has been distracted by legitimate political noise, but once earnings season starts, I think the story will change dramatically,” said Ross Gerber, chief executive officer of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth & Investment Management. Gerber’s firm owns Netflix shares and he expects subscriber growth to exceed estimates.

391,391,2018-04-17,"Microsoft ($725.09 B) just surpassed Alphabet/Google ($724.96 B) and Amazon ($697.84 B) in market cap, and with augmented reality, cloud computing, and the Surface lineup, MSFT is a BUY Microsoft, Apple, Google, and Amazon are neck and neck these days when it comes to technology and market cap. Out of the four of them, Microsoft looks like the most solid buy, and not just because they’re the only American company aside from J&J to have a AAA credit rating.

Apple is a victim of its own success. The iPhone X will reportedly be discontinued due to it’s unjustifiably large thousand dollar+ price tag and lagging sales. Which is why the gold iPhone X was never introduced and the Product Red iPhone 8 is being promoted instead. Apple has invented nothing impressive after Jobs’ passing. The Apple Watch is a flop with apps being removed including Instagram, Amazon, Google Maps, EBay, Slack, and more, most likely due to a lack of use. Now the flip side to the argument as to why you should invest in AAPL is that Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is invested in Apple, and as of this writing AAPL is actually their largest holding. Buffett’s reasoning because Apple has a large “moat” meaning that consumer loyalty to the brand is super impressive. But with HomePod completely missing the targets and being a thorough disappointment with an inept Siri and again super high price tag, Apple is pushing the limits on what it can get away with. Maybe the Oracle of Omaha sees something I don’t, but when I want to see the cutting edge in technology I go to the Microsoft Store to test out Hololens, not see another iteration of the iPad Pro which now supports Pencil.

Google is a mixed bag with awesome strengths as well as warning signs it may just be a follower in the industry, and not a good one at that. The strengths of Google are that it still has a monopoly on search, its maps apps (Maps, Waze, Earth) are unrivaled, and it is dominating the classroom with its free online productivity suite of Docs, Sheets, and Slides. Not to mention the fact that YouTube is unrivaled, Google Chrome is unrivaled, and Android is unrivaled when it comes to an iOS alternative. The weaknesses of Google is that they sometimes have no idea what they are doing and fail spectacularly. Google Glass was creepy. Google Plus was lame. Google Nexus went nowhere. And even though Android is breaking record numbers as the world’s most popular OS, Google still clings to their vision of a webpage-centric OS in their flailing ChromeOS. So flailing in fact that they had to suck some energy from Android and make Android apps compatible with ChromeOS.

Amazon is a company I hate with a passion. They abuse their warehouse workers, Jeff Bezos is the richest person on the planet yet he refuses to donate to charity nor conduct interviews except for maybe one by his brother, and this hunger games Amazon is having cities do to impress them for a second headquarters is just messed up and totally fake (Boston is still in the running and they explicitly said they’re offering jack shit with regard to tax breaks). Plus reports are coming in that Whole Foods is being ruined from within: upper management has left, suppliers have left after fees were increased, produce is lagging in quality for the first time, stores are forced to become more centralized and less locally involved, and shelves are deliberately being left empty because of a new system of stocking which may be more efficient but looks awful. Can’t wait for Amazon to fail on this one just like they did with their Fire Phone.

Microsoft is by far the most impressive tech company on this list. Their hardware is top notch, making them safe in an era where companies who make their money on data, like Facebook and Google, are caught in the crosshairs of public perception and backlash. Microsoft’s CEO Satya Nadella is a thoroughly impressive individual who has worked at Microsoft for decades, is humble as well as decisive, and seems to be ready to cut tech that isn’t working for the company while fostering growth and innovation for sectors of the company that have potential or are currently working well. Microsoft Stores are opening up and introducing people to innovative tech straight from the company itself.

In summary I’d say that Microsoft is going to continue to trend upwards, Google’s fate is in their own hands, Apple is not going anywhere better, and Amazon will continue to slide. And when it comes to long term success, I’m more likely to invest in tech companies that do hardware and have a physical presence like their own stores (Microsoft, Apple) than companies who rely totally on reputation (Amazon, Google save for Nest and Pixel).",MSFT,microsoft 72509 b surpassed alphabetgoogle 72496 b amazon 69784 b market cap augmented reality cloud computing surface lineup msft buy microsoft apple google amazon neck neck day come technology market cap four microsoft look like solid buy ’ american company aside jj aaa credit rating apple victim success iphone x reportedly discontinued due ’ unjustifiably large thousand dollar price tag lagging sale gold iphone x never introduced product red iphone 8 promoted instead apple invented nothing impressive job ’ passing apple watch flop apps removed including instagram amazon google map ebay slack likely due lack use flip side argument invest aapl warren buffett ’ berkshire hathaway invested apple writing aapl actually largest holding buffett ’ reasoning apple large “ moat ” meaning consumer loyalty brand super impressive homepod completely missing target thorough disappointment inept siri super high price tag apple pushing limit get away maybe oracle omaha see something ’ want see cutting edge technology go microsoft store test hololens see another iteration ipad pro support pencil google mixed bag awesome strength well warning sign may follower industry good one strength google still monopoly search map apps map waze earth unrivaled dominating classroom free online productivity suite doc sheet slide mention fact youtube unrivaled google chrome unrivaled android unrivaled come io alternative weakness google sometimes idea fail spectacularly google glass creepy google plus lame google nexus went nowhere even though android breaking record number world ’ popular o google still cling vision webpagecentric o flailing chromeos flailing fact suck energy android make android apps compatible chromeos amazon company hate passion abuse warehouse worker jeff bezos richest person planet yet refuse donate charity conduct interview except maybe one brother hunger game amazon city impress second headquarters messed totally fake boston still running explicitly said ’ offering jack shit regard tax break plus report coming whole food ruined within upper management left supplier left fee increased produce lagging quality first time store forced become centralized le locally involved shelf deliberately left empty new system stocking may efficient look awful ’ wait amazon fail one like fire phone microsoft far impressive tech company list hardware top notch making safe era company make money data like facebook google caught crosshairs public perception backlash microsoft ’ ceo satya nadella thoroughly impressive individual worked microsoft decade humble well decisive seems ready cut tech ’ working company fostering growth innovation sector company potential currently working well microsoft store opening introducing people innovative tech straight company summary ’ say microsoft going continue trend upwards google ’ fate hand apple going anywhere better amazon continue slide come long term success ’ likely invest tech company hardware physical presence like store microsoft apple company rely totally reputation amazon google save nest pixel,Positive,0.9908
392,392,2018-04-22,"How to play extremely high-risk FDs with 1000% upside. With $JNJ and $AAPL as examples. Since [my last thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/8azo6j/if_you_bought_into_my_options_plays_thread/), I've been getting a lot of messages from people wanting more trade ideas. I promised another thread last week but ended up forgetting. I had a lot of fun writing this up last night while drinking beer and watching the Harry Potter movies. This took two entire Harry Potter movies to write. Prisoner of Azkaban is the best one.

Since you all love throwing your money away, I'll share how I play FDs. I cannot ~~understate~~ overstate the risk involved here. I try to minimize risk by proactively closing out of an FD early if, for example, volume action in the morning is low (whether or not it opens green). I take into account many other things, which I won't go over in this thread, but just remember that nothing in this thread is even remotely close to being safe. If you're serious about following my advice here, please read the entire thread.

I only pursue FDs if there exists a realistic and reasonable scenario in which hitting a 1000% profit is not simply grasping at straws. I'll elaborate on this later. The title is not clickbait. It's possible to hit a 1000% banger over the course of a week with this strategy so long as you can stomach the losses you *will* come across. *A lot* of things need to happen for me to take the risk and open a play like this, and even more things need to go right -- with the correct timing -- to turn a profit. To show you what I mean, I'll share two example plays for this coming week. Do note that **the timing for these plays may have already passed**. Depending on what happens come Monday morning, if the following tickers open green and don't go back down enough for call prices to depress, it may be too late to get in on the 1000% action. 

In my opinion, these plays are simply not worth it if there isn't a realistic potential for 1000% gains because you will undoubtedly lose money on most of them. So you need big hits to justify the losses. If you're only looking at a 500% gain come Monday morning, assuming these tickers open green, proceed at your own peril. I personally don't mess with FDs if I'm only looking at a realistic upside of 500%.

**Johnson and Johnson ($JNJ)**
-

I haven't bought into this play yet because I was at work and forgot. I learned the hard way with PTLA that sharing plays early with you lot, before I've bought into them, can bite me in the ass. After I shared my play, call prices for PTLA went up and never dropped back down again afterwards, even though the share price went down... Regardless, JNJ will serve as a good example, and if Monday is red, there may be an opportunity to buy in. 

So, why a long-term company like JNJ specifically? This past week has been rough on JNJ. The company announced average earnings, which the market really didn't like because I honestly have no idea. There were some other tidbits of news surrounding JNJ recently, but I personally thought JNJ's results were fine. Not great, but still fine. Even before this report, JNJ got beat up a lot and share price had stagnated to where it was at almost a full year ago. I didn't have a stake in it, but I thought JNJ would go up with not-bad news. Not down. JNJ is near its 52-week low and is still a great company, with a great dividend, in a great market.

Thus sets the scene for a high-risk, 1000% banger. Great.

-

**READ THE FOLLOWING POINTS CAREFULLY.** They outline the kind of thought process I go through to justify playing FDs. There are different justifications for different companies and scenarios. Hopefully, with enough examples, you'll begin to see things through my gambling-tinted glasses. These points are listed in order of decreasing importance. 

1. JNJ earnings have passed, so options no longer carry high IV. 

2. JNJ is a historically safe growth company (for a biotech), and options are priced to reflect this usual stability. This is basically the Disney of pharmaceuticals, and like Disney, JNJ is very safe. We're banking on some unexpected volatility. 

3. Other major companies are announcing earnings next week, which, if positive, could lead to a huge reversal in the market. Google reports Monday. This is a double-edged sword because if Google shits the bed Monday, it's all over. 

4. There is no JNJ-specific news coming next week, other than a dividend increase announcement. This also greatly reduces IV. 

5. This is where the reasoning becomes less compelling, yet relevant enough to mention. JNJ's average dividend yield is ~2.75% over the past 5 years. JNJ is going to announce a dividend increase this coming week. I'm predicting an increase to 90 cents per quarter because that's more aesthetic than the expected 88 cents per quarter. I do actually believe, unironically, that JNJ will choose 90 cents over 88 cents because it's a better looking number (also tax cuts), so take that for what you will. Anyway, at 90 cents per quarter, JNJ's yield comes out to 2.84% from Friday's close, which is high for a reliable company that grows consistently and is sought after for its dividends. If we go by 90 cents at an average yield of 2.75%, we arrive at a fair share value of ~$131.

6. Open interest in puts and calls is pretty flat, all things considered. Nothing stands out, so that means big players aren't really in on this one way or the other. Sometimes this can be a factor, and sometimes not.

-

And now onto the actual play.

* **JNJ April 27th 131.00 calls**

These are worth 12 cents per contract, going by Friday's closing bid-ask spread. If JNJ goes up to $131 before Wednesday noon, an increase of 3.43%, these calls will **profit ~1000%**. 

If this move happens very early in the day Monday or Tuesday, the profit will be higher. And when I say ""Wednesday noon"", I don't actually mean right at Wednesday noon. What I really mean is early enough during the day on Wednesday so that the options are priced for a larger potential increase. If the target price of $131 is hit Wednesday at closing or Thursday open, these calls will profit less. 

These estimates are going to be off because we're dealing with moves that are far-fetched. Greeks will only get you so far when you're trying to predict moves on stuff like this because even the smallest of things -- like what *time* of day share price moves, with what kind of volume, on what kind of news, how volatile the market expects to be, etc, etc -- can affect option pricing and thus the final estimates. But, in general, I'm not wrong often.

By the way, if share price gaps down the next day, you're down at least 50%. Even a decrease of 0.5% in underlying share price at open is a death wish.

**Apple ($AAPL)**
-

I personally dislike Apple and its products, but the potential for a 1000% banger was too compelling, so I bought $3000 worth of FDs near Friday closing. I'll get right into the play and reasoning because you probably already know why Apple went down this past week. 

* **AAPL April 27th 172.50 calls**

These calls are worth roughly 55 cents each (I got them at 57 cents). If share price goes up to $172 or so, which is a bit less than where it was at Thursday closing, these calls will **profit ~500%**. If share price goes back up to around $178, which is around where it was at Wednesday closing, these calls will be deeply ITM and **profit ~1000%** regardless of what day of the week it is. Earlier in the week is still better and will yield a greater profit. The 500% profit scenario relies on a move early on in the week. 

Reasoning in decreasing significance: 

1. Apple's earnings report is not this coming week, but the following week on May 1st. This means these calls do not carry high IV. They still have some pretty high IV, but not earnings report kind of high IV. 

2. Other tech giants are reporting next week, with Google reporting *Monday*. This is absolutely huge, and the timing makes this play enticing as hell. A big run-up Tuesday morning following good news with Google means that these calls could go back to the 170-180 level. We have a chance to effectively play an Apple earnings report without buying into the IV of an actual earnings report. When Google shoots up during an earnings report, so too does Apple (usually... kind of...). This isn't only because they're both tech companies, but it plays a big role. This is a heavier connection than the JNJ-Google one mentioned above. 

3. Merrill Lynch is literal trash. 

4. Again, this is much less compelling, but still relevant enough to put in here. There isn't a lot of open interest for calls at this expiration date. Open interest is relatively low for every price until you get to $175 strike. There is however a lot of open interest for puts ranging from OTM puts to ITM puts up to $175 strike. So I believe that big money sold a ton of puts, but not a lot of calls, because they expect a move up to a little less than $175/share. Big money players may try to pin share price at around $175 so calls at this strike price don't go ITM. They then get to rake in them premiums from both ends of the stick. 

5. With the tax cuts and Apple's big win regarding cash repatriation, I expect Tim Cook to swoop in and save the day next week with huge buybacks. We already know Apple and other companies (assuming they're good at timing buybacks) love to buy back shares when sentiment is low and share price has taken a slump. I think that these buybacks will spark a big rally when coupled with good earnings.

-

As always, risk is very high and you know the drill by now. A bad report by Google means there's a good chance both of these plays fall flat. If everything doesn't go exactly as planned, these plays will fall flat. Keep that in mind before you think about following along the 1000% road.

400,400,2018-05-02,"Apple may give investors less cash than they expect and that could hit the stock, Barclays says Apple may have to allocate more cash than expected to acquisitions, which risks returning less to investors and that could be a headwind for the stock, according to FuninUSA.


Barclays slashed its price target for the iPhone maker for the second time in two months on Monday, as reported by FuninUSA.


In a note titled ""It Might Rain on Buyback Exuberance,"" Barclays put a price target of $157 on Apple, down from $168, representing a nearly 5 percent downside from Monday's close.


The problem it sees is that many people are holding the stock because of high expectations around capital return. Apple said that it will bring back its offshore cash of around $258 billion to the U.S. following President Donald Trump's plan to reduce the tax rate on money repatriated to America.


Many analysts from FuninUSA expect Apple to announce a significant share buyback program and dividend increase. Barclays said that many investors are holding Apple stock in hope of a payout, but the risk is that Apple could give back less than expected, because more money needs to go to acquisitions due to the possibility of weaker iPhone sales.


Barclays analysts said that Apple could return $84 billion to shareholders in addition to the $52 billion left under the current $300 billion capital return program. This could consist of $21 billion in dividends and $63 billion in share repurchases.


The bank has a lower expectation on buybacks than other analysts. Morgan Stanley expects Apple's capital returns program to total $210 billion in shares and $52 billion in dividends, leaving $30 billion for acquisitions.

NVDA - 3%
AAPL - 7%
AMZN- 7%
GOOG - 18%

I have been holding some GOOG shares since it was at ~840 and yesterday I added 6 more. And once I get more money, I am actually thinking of increasing my position even more.

I am not good at evaluating companies but when I look around GOOG is slowly taking over and there is still so much potential growth. 

1). Data - Google has so much data. It is INSANE. They know about billions of humans and their behavior, business, streets, pictures (with google photos) It is absolutely nuts. which brings me to my next two point (AI and Cars)

2). AI - we know that AI is going to be a huge part of our everyday life going forward. And with the amount of data GOOGLE has, they are on the TOP spot to leverage and make their AI the best. This isn't even an opinion right? FB, Microsoft, and Amazon doesn't even have fraction of data that Google has. And AI is all about machine learning, and the more data you feed, smarter it gets. 

3). Automobile- This is uncharted territory, no one has been able to penetrate and challenge the big car giants like GM, Toyota, Audi etc. Once Elon Musk was asked a question, who does he see as his competitor and his answer was Apple. I don't know if he was being ignorant or genuinely don't see Google as a major competitor.    

Google's approach to automobile is same as their approach to Android. They do what they do the best (create software and services) and let the hardware people make the hardware. Seems like they are on the same path with cars, they are creating the best selfdriving system and infrastructure and just going to sell this to other car manufactures, who already know how to build cars. And just like Pixel line up, we might see cars made by Google at some point. But the thing is, how can anyone not see Google as a serious competitor is beyond my understanding.

As earnings season continues, one thing is becoming clear: tech is king.

Coming into Q1 releases, conventional wisdom was that sectors such as energy and financials would be the big winners. Tech, on the other hand, had largely led the moves down over the last couple of months, and was not often mentioned as a place to be. Energy earnings are, as expected, showing tremendous growth, which is hardly surprising if you so much as glance at a chart showing oil prices, while early in the season most financial firms did reveal the expected increase in trading profits.

The headline grabbers, however, have been in tech, and especially big tech.

The big four, Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX), and Google (GOOGL), collectively known as the FANG stocks, have all reported EPS beats, ranging from a penny in the case of Netflix to a massive 168% upside surprise from Amazon.

424,424,2018-06-19,"$WMT $GOOG partnership tendies Google market cap is $817b
Wal-Mart is $245b
JD is $62b
Flipkart about $20b
Amazon is $836b

Does Google (Alphabet) go in and aquire Wal-Mart? They would control the two biggest foreign markets and allow Wal-Mart to compete with Amazon. The marketing and advertisements and potential is huge. There are a ton of synergies already but it would make perfect sense if Google bought Wal-Mart and cheap for valuation. 

Walmart’s total revenue for the last fiscal was over $500 billion, while Amazon’s net sales were $177.9 billion. Walmart showed net income of over $20 billion, while Amazon’s net income was $3 billion. Yet, Amazon today is among the top five companies in the world in terms of market capitalisation at over $680 billion market cap. 

Why outright aquire them? Access to all markers with a stronghold. And data. Lots of data. 

Amazon has a decent shot at this, given how deeply it understands your purchase history. Google? Not so much, at least not before the Walmart deal. Google Express already partners with some big names—including Costco and Walgreens—but has such a negligible market share that it can’t reliably know what you want, when you want it.

Alphabet Inc.’s Google unit is investing $550 million in Chinese online retailer JD.com Inc., a move that will deepen its ties with China and ramp up its rivalry with Amazon.com Inc.

https://www.google.com/amp/s/techcrunch.com/2018/04/02/walmart-brings-its-partnership-with-jd-com-into-the-food-business/amp/

Wal-Mart already has a partnership with JD. Synergy there. 

https://www.google.com/amp/amp.timeinc.net/fortune/2018/05/07/walmart-google-india-flipkart-amazon

Walmart’s acquisition plan for Flipkart will likely involve Google’s parent Alphabet taking a minority stake in India’s largest ecommerce company, said people with knowledge of the matter. Alphabet will probably invest $1-2 billion after the Walmart acquisition, expected to be announced shortly, they added. Walmart said earlier this month it will pay $16 billion for a roughly 77 percent stake in Flipkart, the U.S. retailer's largest-ever deal.

447,447,2018-07-22,"WSJ: Tesla Asks Suppliers for Cash Back to Help Turn a Profit Tesla Inc. (TSLA) has asked some suppliers to refund a portion of what the electric-car company has spent previously, an appeal that reflects the auto maker’s urgency to sustain operations during a critical production period.

The Silicon Valley electric car company said it is asking its suppliers for cash back to help it become profitable, according to a memo reviewed by The Wall Street Journal that was sent to a supplier last week. Tesla requested the supplier return what it calls a meaningful amount of money of its payments since 2016, according to the memo.

The auto maker’s memo, sent by a global supply manager, described the request as essential to Tesla’s continued operation and characterized it as an investment in the car company to continue the long-term growth between both players.

While Tesla said in the memo that all suppliers were being asked to help it become profitable, it is unclear how many were asked for a discount on contracted spending amounts retroactively. Some suppliers contacted about the request said they were unaware of such a demand.

Tesla declined to comment on the specific memo. But it confirmed it is seeking price reductions from suppliers for projects, some of which date back to 2016, and some of which final acceptance many not yet have occurred. The company called such requests a standard part of procurement negotiations to improve its competitive advantage, especially as it ramps up Model 3 production.

The surprising requests raise further questions about Tesla’s cash position, which has dwindled after it struggled to boost production of its first car designed for mainstream buyers, the Model 3. After months of delays, Tesla last quarter reached its longstanding goal of making 5,000 Model 3s in a single week, which, if sustained, will help it generate cash.

Auto makers and suppliers have complicated relationships, each fighting for the best deal under immense pricing pressure. Supply chain consultants say sometimes auto makers will demand a reduction in price for a current contract going forward or use leverage of awarding a new deal to get upfront savings on a contract. But they say it is unusual for an auto maker to ask for a refund for past work.",TSLA,wsj tesla asks supplier cash back help turn profit tesla inc tsla asked supplier refund portion electriccar company spent previously appeal reflects auto maker ’ urgency sustain operation critical production period silicon valley electric car company said asking supplier cash back help become profitable according memo reviewed wall street journal sent supplier last week tesla requested supplier return call meaningful amount money payment since 2016 according memo auto maker ’ memo sent global supply manager described request essential tesla ’ continued operation characterized investment car company continue longterm growth player tesla said memo supplier asked help become profitable unclear many asked discount contracted spending amount retroactively supplier contacted request said unaware demand tesla declined comment specific memo confirmed seeking price reduction supplier project date back 2016 final acceptance many yet occurred company called request standard part procurement negotiation improve competitive advantage especially ramp model 3 production surprising request raise question tesla ’ cash position dwindled struggled boost production first car designed mainstream buyer model 3 month delay tesla last quarter reached longstanding goal making 5000 model 3 single week sustained help generate cash auto maker supplier complicated relationship fighting best deal immense pricing pressure supply chain consultant say sometimes auto maker demand reduction price current contract going forward use leverage awarding new deal get upfront saving contract say unusual auto maker ask refund past work,Positive,0.9849

What they do say:

* California company. 
* In the markets of cable cutting  (ditching cable TV in favor of streaming service alternatives)
* NOT a Streaming company, but compares it to being ""instead the gold digger, the one selling the picks and shovels"" so probably some sort of middle management akin to something like Roku.
* Big moneybag investors are quietly buying it.  

So rather than jump in like an idiot, I've been looking around trying to find this supposed cash cow company, and all i seem to find is nothing. This instantly strikes me as suspicious. Why wouldn't a promising company have their name on google for me to find? So my next step was checking out /r/cordcutters.

456,456,2018-07-30,"FAANG is Weakening. Should Investors Worry? ## The FAANG Trade Starts to Crack

### Key Points

* One of the most popular trades in the stock market is showing signs of weakness.
* Luckily, the damage should be contained within the weak stocks.
* Investors should keep an eye on the tech sector.

### What is FAANG?

Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google – the FAANG stocks. Many investors see these stocks as a proxy of the overall stock market. Prior to the recent earnings, these companies were worth about $3.5 trillion. The S&P 500 has a total market capitalization of $23 trillion, so  FAANG makes up an eighth of the index.

These stocks became famous in 2015/2016. During this time, the S&P 500 and other major stock indices were volatile. However, while many stocks were falling, the FAANG stocks were supporting the markets. These stocks helped prevent further losses in the major indices.

Since, this group of stocks have become famous. The FAANG trade has been a great buy over the last several years, and since, the trade has become very crowded. “The five stocks together have been the most crowded trade for the past six months, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch survey of institutional investors in July.” ([Source](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/26/worlds-most-crowded-stocks-fang-burns-investors-in-q2-earnings.html))

Right now, only a couple companies are showing signs of weakness, mainly Facebook and Netflix. In this blog, we will analyze FAANG, and determine whether the stocks are still an important asset to the stock market and what they are saying about the economy.

## Apple

Apple (AAPL) is the largest company but it has not reported 2nd quarter earnings. We will start with them. 

AAPL has been in a channel since it gapped a resistance around $127. Since the breakout, the stock has moved from $127 to Friday’s close of $190.98, a rise of nearly 50%. 

The stock is currently sitting near the top of the channel. The important price zones are outside of the channel. When earnings are released, we will want to watch for the price to break below or above the channel. A buy signal would occur upon an upwards breakout. A sell signal would occur if the stock breaks below the channel support line. Because the sell signal is so far away, now may not be a great time to open a position.

With Apple currently sitting at a $938 billion market capitalization, it is really close to becoming the first trillion dollar company. A good earnings report could propel the stock to the history making valuation. 

## Amazon

Next in market capitalization is Amazon (AMZN). After a good earnings report, the stock moved slightly upwards. Other market forces likely played a role as the NASDAQ Composite fell more than 1.4% on Friday. 

The stock has been in an uptrend since it bottomed in 2001, after the dot com bubble popped. Over the last 17 years the stock has moved from $6 to $1,817.27 on Friday’s close. This long term uptrend has been impressive as the stock has gained 30,187% over these 17 years.

The stock has recently broke a minor resistance at $1,600, and it seems poised to continue climbing. Right now, the important levels to look out for are the $1,600 support, and the green dashed uptrend line. A break of either of these would be a sell signal. 

While the stock has performed very well, there is a risk that it is a bubble. The stock has an extremely high P/E ratio, greater the 225. The stock is priced rather high, and it is because so many investors believe this is the company of the future.  The problem is that there are going to be more economic hardships before it gets to that point, so pricing the stock so high may be a mistake. At this point, it may be best to wait for a large downturn in the stock, before buying it at these elevated levels. 

## Alphabet

The third largest company is Alphabet (Google, GOOGL). The company has become what investors imagine Amazon can become. It has changed the way every person interacts within society, and the world. It has shaped the internet into what it is today, and continues to be a driver of innovation and technology.

The stock has essentially been in an uptrend since its IPO, only taking a minor dip during the Financial Crisis. Compared to Amazon, the company is a much better value. The P/E ratio is 53, which is still high, but investors are still expecting future earnings growth. 

The stock has been in a minor channel for the last three years, and is currently sitting at the top of it. In addition, the MACD and RSI are also sitting at elevated levels, so the stock could be ready to sell off soon. 

However, the stock and company earnings still look bullish, so the stock is likely to remain within the channel. Given the current status of the stock, it may be best to wait until the stock falls back towards the bottom of the channel, before purchasing.

## Facebook

Facebook comes in fourth, in terms of market capitalization. After the company released earnings on Wednesday, the stock fell around 20% losing nearly $120 billion in market value. This was the largest drop of market cap. value in a single day, in U.S. stock market history.

After the giant drop, the stock may be sitting at a good place to buy. The 20% drop brought the stock down to its uptrend line, or the bottom of the channel. 

This is a great place to buy because the sell signal is close by. So, if you believe the company and stock can make a comeback, this is a great place to add the stock to your portfolio. Your stop should be placed just below the trend line. 

Before you buy though, you will want to be believe the stock can indeed make a comeback. Continual selling pressure could continue to scare other investors into selling their positions, so the stock could remain volatile. 

After seeing the results of Twitter, the social media space could be wavering, and these companies may not be as strong as investors once thought.

## Netflix

Lastly, we look at Netflix (NFLX). The stock was the first of the FAANGs to release earnings, and it was disappointing. Many investors feared that it could be a sign of a spillover, and the rest of the FAANG members could see weakness as well. 

The stock has fallen more than 11% since it released earnings on July 16th. The stock recently broke above an upward sloping resistance line, at the beginning of 2018. 

This line has now turned into a support. If the stock continues to fall, the support level could become important. Investors should look to open a position closer to that support line because the sell signal should be placed just below it. 

## What Happened to Facebook and Netflix?

Netflix and Facebook left investors disappointed after their earnings reports. In Netflix’s case, they aren’t gaining the amount of subscribers investors want to see. 

Netflix has a lot of costs associated with the company. Producing their own content and scaling the business across the world is extremely expensive, so investors wanted to see high subscriber growth to combat against those costs. 

Facebook on the other hand, lost revenue  from a lack of ad sales. It seems that the recent changes in European Union law, and the recent data scandal with Data Analytica have had large affects on the company. Also, both companies project weaker growth in the coming quarters.

## Is the Economy at Fault?

So are the issues of Netflix and Facebook tied to the economy? Facebook’s worries are likely to be contained within Facebook. While new laws and regulations are hurting the company right now, eventually the company is likely to comeback. 

With 2 billion users across the globe, companies are going to want to advertise on their platform. Once Facebook can bring the level of security it requires, and users begin to trust them again, advertisers will start to use the company again. If it were truly a sign of economic weakness, then Alphabet (Google) would have shown weak advertising earnings as well.

Netflix may be a little different. Investors were upset because they missed subscriber growth targets. This could be due to the economic slow downs across the globe, relative to the U.S. economy. International economies are weaker than many people thought in 2017, and that could be a reason subscriber growth weakened the last quarter.

## Is the Stock Market in Jeopardy?

First, only two out of five stocks are hurting. Plus, they are the smallest stocks, in terms of market capitalization. Neither stock is positioned badly, and it wouldn’t be a surprise if they started to move up again. 

Secondly, the market relies on these stocks a lot less now. Index breadth is high. More than 64% of the Nasdaq 100 is above their 50-day moving averages while the S&P 500 is at 67% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is at 87%. The stock market is much more robust compared to the time when FAANG was a major support. 

Investors do need to pay attention to the crowded technology sector however. While the sector has been a great performer, we are starting to see not all companies can keep up with Wall Street expectations.

A crowded trade means that prices can move swiftly. It may not be a bad idea to loosen some exposure to the sector while some stocks are at all-time highs. 

## Conclusion

FAANG has become a household name to most investors because of their stellar performance over the last few years. But, the trade has become crowded as these stocks have become some of the highest holdings in institutional portfolios. 

Now, we are starting to see some cracks in the stock group as Facebook and Netflix missed earnings. The two smallest stocks of the group have had their stocks punished, causing an 11% drop in Netflix stock, and the single largest loss of market capitalization in U.S. stock market history, in Facebook.

Even though these stocks have struggled over the last few days, they are still bullishly positioned on the charts. In fact, at this point, all of the FAANG stocks still look poised to grow. However, this changes if the stocks cross any of the sell points previously mentioned.

The missed earnings reports are also likely to remain contained within the stocks themselves. Facebook had the data scandal to deal with, and Netflix is spending more and more money on content, and failing to gain as many subscribers as expected. If these companies hiccuped because of the economy, we would have likely seen it in Amazon and Alphabet (Google) shares as well. 

Lastly, the overall health of the stock market is not in jeopardy either. There are still plenty of stocks marching the indices higher. Plus, the two smallest FAANG companies are showing weakness. The net drag that they have on the indices is minimal relative to the other companies within FAANG. Right now, Facebook and Netflix are not likely to change the direction of the stock market.

466,466,2018-08-09,"Long MSFT Calls - Price Increases I work in the industry and all the buzz the past week has been about MSFT increasing prices starting October 1st. The meat and potatoes of this is that they are screwing over large customers who have what they call ""enteprise agreements"" that give them better discounts and more flexible license options, price locks, deploy now pay later, things like that. They are increasing pricing on specific products anywhere from 10%-30%. This is basically their continued effort to squeeze people in to their pay monthly/yearly per user subscription model because they make more money. As this continues to unfold and large customers who have not yet moved to cloud/subscription model will have their hands forced by Microsoft and basically not have a choice but to do so. MSFT profits are going to soar and we're going to be eating tendies.

467,467,2018-08-09,"Is Musk getting the Shorts to pay for TSLA going private? I think we may be about to witness the greatest financial judo move in recorded history: **Musk will make Tesla private and bury the Shorts, using their own money**. It will not cost him a dime. Detailed explanation below:

Why is this even conceivable? Because Tesla is the most shorted stock ever. There are more shorts to cover than shareholders who would prefer to cash-out at $420.

[Some TSLA data](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/tsla/key-statistics/):

* Shares outstanding: 171M 
* Float: 127M shares, of which:
 * Musk: [34M shares](https://www.nasdaq.com/quotes/insiders/musk-elon-831665)
 * Institutionals: 81M shares.

     Almost all of them (above 70M shares) are not prohibited from holding shares in a private company.
 * Other (incl retail investors): 12M shares.


      Note there aren't enough of those to significantly change the picture.

* Short interest: [35M shares](https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/tsla/short-interest)

Now let's *assume*: 

* This is real. Elon actually has someone willing to buy out any shareholder who doesn't want to, or cannot, go private, at $420.
* Most institutional investors will chose to remain with the privatized Tesla and not exit at $420.
* The board approves, and it goes to a shareholder vote, with a guaranteed 2/3rd majority of Musk and almost all the top institutionals.

What will happen? 

* You have 35M shorts to cover. Less than 35M shares to do that. Nobody will sell for less than the 420 they know they'll get anyway. Result: [Volkswagen-style short squeeze](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-volkswagen/short-sellers-make-vw-the-worlds-priciest-firm-idUSTRE49R3I920081028).
* Anybody who wants out can sell during the short squeeze. 
* If the squeeze goes high enough, some shareholders may change their mind and sell anyway. Probably all the shorts will be covered, but significantly north of 420.
* The only shareholders remaining after the squeeze are those who want to take their stocks into the private stage.

Result: There are no shareholders left that need to be bought out at $420. The short squeeze took care of those. Tesla goes private. Cost to Musk: ZERO.

A classic judo move - use your opponent's momentum against them.

I realize the above scenario sounds insane. But the logic is sound. Even if more institutionals want out, the short squeeze will take care of most of them, and the actual cost of privatization will be a small fraction of TSLA's valuation.

If you think this is BS, please explain why.

485,485,2018-09-08,"Why are some stocks valued in the 1000s of dollars like Amazon and Google when they pay no dividends? Their earning per share is around $5-20 a share. Why are they worth that much if you're not getting much out of owning these stocks?

If you look at Amazon, their total asset is  $131,310,000,000 for 2017 and they have  285,850,780  total shares, their asset/shares is only $459.35 yet the stock is worth around $2000.

Amazon's net income for 2017 was $3,033,000,000 for the year. Even if they were to use it 100% to pay dividends (which they won't) it will be $10.61per share (net income/total shares). The price to dividend would be $10.61/$1952.07 which would be 0.544% which is really low. Stocks that pays dividend usually pay 2-3%, to get that result they would have to grow their net income to 400-600% and I don't even know how much their revenue would have to grow to get that kind of net income. I'm not a financial analyst, I'm just like crunching some random numbers and I just don't see the potential for the stock's dividend.

1st Edit: google EPS is around $20 not $15.

2nd Edit: saw some comments saying people are buying these stocks cause of the potential for growth and that eventually the stock would pay dividends and added more to the post.

3rd Edit: Amazon's total share outstanding is 487 million not 285,850,780 (got confused with total institutional holding shares) and the P/E is 176.86. So 1/176.86 \* their market cap should be how much their net income should be which is 0.005654 \* 948.315B = 5.362B and they will probably beat that for this year so if you look at it this way their stock price should be even higher than $1900 - $2000.

521,521,2018-11-22,"US Stocks Day Off: Markets Never Sleeps [Markets](https://www.fxpro.com/) diligently tried to defend their positions before the holidays in the USA. American indices had completed the trading on Wednesday almost unchanged, after losing about 4% in first two days of the week. The stocks of the energy sector companies had bounced off by 1-2% following the oil after a 6% plunge in the previous day.

American markets are closed on Thursday, and on Friday there is going to be a shortened trading session with a significant part of the players staying away from the trading. This had reinforced the focus on the trading dynamics in the first half of the week.

As we have noted earlier, despite the negative dynamics of the market favorites in previous months and years, market participants are far from panic. Index VIX has been traded near 20 for about a month, keeping its position despite the decline in shares.

&#x200B;

The easing of the Fed's rhetoric last week has turned the dollar into decline, although this has not yet much affected the stock prices. The traders with shares are still afraid of possible problems with sales of the Apple stocks and are concerned about the exhaustion of the overall effect of tax reform on the economic growth.

The foreign exchange market is often the first to react on the changes in external conditions. And it has already given its verdict to the Fed’s sentiment, throwing away the dollar from the multi-month highs. The development of this trend will soften the market’s financial conditions, strengthening support for the shares.

&#x200B;

Moreover, the yield of the U.S. government bonds has been declining over the past two weeks. The yield of 10-years U.S. Treasuries had decreased from 3.25% to 3.06%. If at the initial stage this could be attributed to an increased demand for protective assets and was under the accompaniment of the dollar growth, the further yield decline (price growth) last week has related to the revision of the Fed’s policy expectations. 

Now it does not sound so unequivocally hawkish as in the start of October and that is also able to return the demand for stocks if this trend proves to be sustainable.

524,524,2018-11-25,"Is FANG maxed out? The most promising technologies of the next decade (2020 and beyond) and which companies to invest in? During a bear market, tech and other growth companies are generally the ones that experience the biggest corrections in share prices due to poor fundamentals and high P/E ratios. However, it doesn't change the fact that investing in general is always about future value. Obviously 'future' is subjective and will vary from person to person, as some people are looking to invest for 5 years while others are looking to set-and-forget for 20+ years, but the point is - people are essentially making a long-term bet that the company will evolve into a stronger leader in its respective industry.

FANG (Facebook ($FB), Amazon ($AMZN), Netflix ($NFLX), and Alphabet ($GOOG)) have been the 4 powerhouse tech stocks that consistently beat the market. As of August 10, 2017 — while the NASDAQ 100 was up 19 percent and the S&P 500 was up 8.9 percent year-to-date (YTD) — FANGs were up more than 2x that of the latter. Year-to-date, Facebook (FB) was up 45 percent, Amazon (AMZN) 27 percent, Netflix (NFLX) 36 percent and Alphabet’s Google (GOOG) 16 percent, beating the returns of both indices. (Source: Yahoo Finance)

As we reach the peak of the 'tech bubble', people have questioned whether the year-over-year growth for FANG is sustainable, while others added to their bullish sentiment with the inclusion of other industry leaders -- In Sept. 2018, CNBC published an article that said that Square ($SQ) should be part of the FANG group based on the hyper-bullish sentiment of a Nomura Instinet analyst, who also set a massive price target of $125 per share.

October 2018 - The Motley Fool came out with an article ([https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/10/09/forget-fang-stocks-meet-mana.aspx](https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/10/09/forget-fang-stocks-meet-mana.aspx)) titled \*Forget FANG Stocks: Meet MANA\* (Microsoft ($MSFT), Apple ($AAPL), Netflix ($NFLX), Amazon ($AMZN))

Q3 ERs for most tech companies were disasters - most beat Q2 expectations, but they slipped on the Q4 guidance. Whether you believe that they are sandbagging is up to you, but people hoped that strong ER and Q4 guidance from FANG/FANGS/FAANG/MANA was going to prop up the market from further slide -- they didn't. If I recall correctly, Netflix was the one that had the strongest ER and jumped nearly 13% in the after hours. Apple bombed on their iPhone sales and announced that going forward, they would no longer be reporting iPhone sales unit numbers. People started to question whether FANG had enough innovation left in their tanks to continue to grow and drive expansion.

\*\*So what's next?\*\* There are a number of advancements that are on the verge of a major breakthrough and adoption:

\* Robotics/AI

\* 5G

\* Quantum computing

\* Internet of Things (IoT)

\* Blockchain (this does not necessarily mean cryptocurrencies)

\* Gene editing/modification

\* Healthcare/Biotech/Pharmaceuticals

532,532,2018-11-30,"Is AAPL now ""cheap""? - charts inside I have not really done much fundamental analysis before so hopefully you all can help me out.

&#x200B;

Watching AAPL drop 25% over the past month had me thinking it was now ""cheap"" and a good deal to start buying but according to this PE [CHART](https://imgur.com/a/RgmmL37) it's stock price to earnings is still near 2-year highs and appears to be above average over the past 8-9 years.   So relative to itself, AAPL does not appear cheap here.  



So then I started thinking, maybe AAPL is cheap relative to the index (Nasdaq) in this case.  Here is a 10 year chart showing AAPL's share price is still up 100% relative the Nasdaq.  [Chart Link](https://imgur.com/a/uO5Ayeh)   Again, AAPL does not yet look cheap.  

&#x200B;

Finally I thought maybe AAPL's PE at around 14 is ""cheap"" relative to all market PEs over the past 30 years.  This [Chart](https://imgur.com/a/RzgqUCU) shows AAPL's PE (red x) relative to S&P500 historic PEs over the past 30 years.   So here AAPL is actually start to look like a good buy as investors are paying less per earnings relative to the market average.  

&#x200B;

To me the first two charts show AAPL as being at least fair or average priced right now relative to itself and the last chart shows it to be at a discount relative to the rest of the market.      Am I doing this right or can anyone offer some insight here.  

  
Thanks.

The Times report came on the back of a series of scandals and incidents which have mired Facebook in controversy and sent its stock sinking in 2018. As of its last close, the company's stock price was more than 43 percent off its 52-week high.

Boy was I wrong, and it sucked. As it was the day before Christmas no stores were picking up the phone and it made more sense to just drive to the locations.

Turns out every place was sold out. I checked Best Buy, Target, Walmart,  Khols and the Apple store. All sold out. I asked the managers of these stores if they had any available in any other locations. None. All sold out of every store in a hundred mile radius of a major U.S City.

* * *

Shortly after Apple slashed its revenue guidance for the first quarter, Goldman Sachs said the iPhone maker will likely have to bring down numbers for the full year. As those results drop further, so will the company's shares, the firm said.

""We see the potential for further downside to FY19 numbers depending on the trajectory of Chinese demand in early 2019,"" wrote Goldman's Rod Hall in a note to clients late Wednesday.

The company sees first-quarter revenue of $84 billion vs. a previous guidance of a range of $89 billion and $93 billion. Analysts expected revenue of $91.3 billion for the period, according to the consensus estimate from FactSet. Apple blamed most of the revenue shortfall on a slowing economy in China in the second half.

Apple shares dropped more than 9 percent to $143.70 in premarket trading after ending the first day of 2019 at $157.92. And Goldman's Hall slashed his 12-month forecast to $140 from $182. He also lowered his full-year 2019 revenue estimate by 6 percent to $253 billion and his full-year EPS estimate by 10 percent to $11.66.

Nokia comparison
""We have been flagging China demand issues since late September and Apple's guidance cut confirms our view,"" wrote Hall. ""We do not expect the situation to get better in March and would remain cautious on the region.""

But the analyst went further, comparing Apple to the fallen phone maker Nokia, which became reliant on customer upgrades in the face of a saturated market more than a decade ago. Customers delayed replacing their phones for longer and longer as economy slowed, Goldman notes.

""Nokia saw rapid nexpansion of replacement rates in late 2007 that was well beyond what any linear forecast would have implied,"" wrote Hall. ""Beyond China, we don't see strong evidence of a consumer slowdown heading into 2019 but we just flag to investors that we believe Apple's replacement rates are likely much more sensitive to the macro now that the company is approaching maximum market penetration for the iPhone.""

545,545,2019-01-04,"A discussion on Berkshire Hathaway and Apple With AAPL taking a beating recently, I've been reading a lot of comments about how much money Berkshire Hathaway lost (unrealized losses) and whether Buffet made a mistake again investing outside of his area of expertise (tech stocks).

Here are my thoughts on the matter that I hope will help existing/potential shareholders of AAPL and BRK.B (If you can afford BRK.A, you're ahead of the game than the rest of us).

* Generally speaking, don't do as Berkshire Hathaway does. Instead, invest in BRK.B.
   * Even Buffet makes mistakes.
   * Buffet might not be the one who made the stock purchase. Todd Combs and Ted Weschler are former hedge fund managers who don't hesitate to make short term investments ([https://247wallst.com/energy-business/2016/02/29/warren-buffett-comes-clean-on-kinder-morgan-purchase-it-was-not-me/](https://247wallst.com/energy-business/2016/02/29/warren-buffett-comes-clean-on-kinder-morgan-purchase-it-was-not-me/)). If you buy and sell stock in companies based on what Berkshire Hathaway does, you'll likely buy at a higher price  and liquidate at a lower price than they did.
   * Berkshire Hathaway has access to deals the average investor doesn't have access to ([https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/12/22/warren-buffett-bailed-out-a-bank-then-the-bank-bai.aspx](https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/12/22/warren-buffett-bailed-out-a-bank-then-the-bank-bai.aspx)).
   * Berkshire Hathaway can afford to make mistakes or wait longer for their investment to generate returns because they are not heavily leveraged, don't pay dividends and have massive cash flows ([https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/brk.a/financials/cash-flow](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/brk.a/financials/cash-flow)).

&#x200B;

* Berkshire Hathaway will probably buy more shares of Apple at these depressed valuations.
   * They wouldn't have invested over 50 billion in AAPL unless they are extremely confident in their investment thesis and have calculated the downside. Between Munger, Buffett, Combs and Weschler, you have decades of investment experience. I'll trust the billionaires who have generated market beating returns for their shareholders over random analysts.
   * Berkshire Hathaway places large bets on companies that they believe  is undervalued and they believe can continue generating cash in the long run.
   * *In the first detailed explanation of Berkshire's investment thesis for Apple, Weschler says that the smartphone business had been transformed by the app economy and cloud computing. ""As network speed has gotten faster and faster, and with it the information that people can absorb on the network, things like photo applications, and apps, they create a stickier ecosystem"". Statistics showed that there was a high likelihood iPhone or iPad buyers would also purchase their next device from Apple, he added: ""****Once you are fully invested in the App ecosystem and you have got your thousands of photographs up in the cloud and you are used to the keystrokes and functionality and where everything is, you become a sticky consumer****.""*

&#x200B;

* For the individual investor, AAPL shares are starting to look attractive. Now would be a good point to initialize a small position and dollar cost average as it goes lower.
   * EV/EBITDA and forward PE are approximately 9.5 i.e shares are pretty cheap compared to other stocks.
   * Net Debt/EBITDA \~ 0.5 and interest coverage ratio \~23.5 i.e the company has a solid balance sheet and can easily cover interest payments.
   * Operating margin \~ 26% and ROIC \~ 25% (almost twice that of the s&p500) i.e AAPL is way more profitable than your average publicly traded large cap company.
   * The payout ratio is \~23%. i.e There is ample room for dividend growth because it is well covered by earnings.
   * Over 64 billion in free cash flow last year, only 13 billion of which was paid in dividends. Seeing how the company doesn't have ton of debt, the rest will go into dividends and share buybacks.

All that being said, there's always a possibility that AAPL might turn out to be another IBM.  But having a strong balance sheet and generating massive cash flows minimizes downside risk and gives AAPL time to rethink its growth strategy. There's always risk in the stock market, but a key to generating long term returns is to minimize your downside risk. Also very important to keep in mind that you only invest money that you DO NOT have an immediate need for.

Expect other popular stocks to take a beating at some point in the future when people realize there will be periods when a company cannot keep growing revenues indefinitely.

&#x200B;

At this point I believe BRK.B is a more compelling buy than AAPL though. I get exposure to AAPL and a plethora of other stocks and businesses well entrenched in the American economy. Here is a slightly dated but still relevant slideshow of the true value of Berkshire [https://www.tilsonfunds.com/BRK.pdf](https://www.tilsonfunds.com/BRK.pdf) (Analysis starts after the 15th slide or so).

BRK generally trades at a price to book value around 1.45. It is currently trading at a price to book value of 1.26. Add to that a conservative 5% growth in book value (Though Buffet has said they can manage higher than that) and share buybacks (they recently bought back shares at higher prices because they believed it to be undervalued), I expect annual returns of close to 20% for shares bought today when the shares trade at fair value again.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Buy Berkshire for a conservative portfolio. Consider buying AAPL if you're a more aggressive investor.

&#x200B;

I am long BRK.B

&#x200B;

EDIT: To answer the question as to what would happen to Berkshire after Buffett, the slides address the topic towards the end.

The gist of it is, Buffet's death is already factored into the price and his management team should continue to do a decent job. There might be some volatility in the stock price soon after, but business fundamentals should remain intact. If you want to read more about the topic, I would suggest this book [https://www.amazon.com/Berkshire-Beyond-Buffett-Enduring-Values/dp/0231170041](https://www.amazon.com/Berkshire-Beyond-Buffett-Enduring-Values/dp/0231170041).

549,549,2019-01-13,"NFLX Question Hi all!

I am wondering if NFLX is in for a very rough 2019. 

I like to use Buffett's style of investing -- i.e., if you use something (and you use it frequently etc), it is probably a good choice. 

Within the FANG group, I am currently typing on a Mac, I use Gmail and Google religiously, and Facebook is now everywhere in my life as well for advertising purposes (and has kind of replaced Yahoo as my go-to homepage for garbage news, a surprising success re: their adoption of the new feed). I am also a Netflix user. HOWEVER. 

I have to say that over the past few months, Netflix has begun to lose its luster for me. As I was browsing today, there was no longer anything interesting that caught my eye. They definitely have original content I will watch in the future (the next season of The Crown...?) but even those quality options (House of Cards) are seemingly dwindling. Netflix is increasingly an enormous mass of unwatchable or uninteresting content. 

Does anyone else feel similarly? I could see this seriously impacting their bottom line as we head out another year or two and more and more users begin feeling that Hulu / Amazon Prime have better value. Something else I have been reading is that NFLX quality is declining because noone will license their films / TV to them anymore -- so naturally they are banking on original content, but when your company becomes almost entirely filled with unwatchable original content... that becomes an enormous money waster.

FB, GOOG, AAPL are all smart enough to have developed multiple revenue streams -- I see regular criticism of FB re: more people using IG, and I want to bash my head into a table. But NFLX has not invested in horizontal expansion, instead, they have poured all their $ into themselves, which IMO may turn out to be a very dangerous move, and means they have much less resiliency than FB/GOOG/AAPL. 

Opinions? I do not own stock in NFLX but am considering a short position at some point.

553,553,2019-01-17,"Netflix 'earnings interview' - Thoughts? I have no positions in Netflix. Really been torn on whether to pick some up, so decided to listen today to the earnings call. It is a pre-recorded 'earnings interview', shown on YouTube, with no questions from any analysts. It's just the leaders of the company sitting around interviewing each other; no hard questions from analysts. I was really looking forward to hearing hard questions about their thoughts on more competition, if they may need to raise more cash at some point, etc, etc. This lack of taking hard questions makes me wonder why they wouldn't want to have a call like the vast majority of other companies do. I've never heard anything like this in an 'earnings call'.

Just wondered what others thought of this approach. This was definitely new to me. I always was under the impression (obviously incorrectly) that earnings calls with questions from analysts was something the SEC mandated.

554,554,2019-01-20,"Top 3 Stock picks for 2019 What are your Top 3 stock picks to buy for 2019?

&#x200B;

Here are on my radar (Don't hold any yet), but will probably own 1 of these in the future:

&#x200B;

1. **AT&T (T):** Dividend >5%, P/E ratio at 11.28 (below average), and recently invested to gain streaming rights  to show original movies and television series from Warner Bros., Turner and HBO. Taking into consideration the overall success Netflix, a successful launch could help charge up AT&T's share price, but this would be a slow process as competition will be fierce (Amazon Prime and Disney), and i doubt many people will be willing to have multiple streaming services accounts. 

2. **Apple (AAPL)**: I believe apple will continue hitting new lows, the Chinese market has lost its appetite for apple cellphones, specially after Trump's Tariff and how pricey these devices have become. 


Long term catalyst would be the introduction of 5G network (as I am hoping for AT&T) which should get a lot of people willing to upgrade their phone, apple also has the highest retention of cellphone users (\~96%), but I want to see how they plan to regain the Chinese market or if they will expand to other emerging countries like china to continue its growth.

#### March 21, 2019 (Published March 26, 2019) 

#### Prepared By Brandon Ross, CMT

 Click to read the analysis with charts, and also download a PDF of the report:  [https://www.brtechnicals.com/apple-aapl-stock-report/](https://www.brtechnicals.com/apple-aapl-stock-report/) 

## Long-Term Analysis 

* AAPL is in a long-term channel that began in 2010.
* The channel bottom is moving at the same pace as the 200-week moving average.
   * When a correction occurs, the 200-week moving average and channel bottom act as a support.
* There have been three corrections within this channel.
   * \-45%; -31%; -39%
* The latest drop, in 2018, was the quickest and most volatile. The MACD indicator fell sharply, and is rising just as quickly.
   * 50-week moving average did not have time to correct.
   * However, it was perfect technical setup.
      * The stock peaked at the top of the channel, and stopped its decline at the bottom.
* Does not qualify as an Elliot Wave.
   * In this case, the third wave is the shortest wave, and thus nullifies it as an impulse wave. 

## Medium-Term Analysis 

* A triple top reversal pattern stopped the stock in 2015.
* After a year, and a -31% drop, the stock gapped above the minor downtrend line to begin a 3 year uptrend.  

   * A few weeks later the 50-day moving average crossed back above the 200-day moving average.
* The stock peaked at $230 dollars, and fell through the minor uptrend channel in Q4 2018.  

   * A few weeks later the 50-day moving average fell below the 200-day moving average. 

## Short-Term Analysis 

* The drop in 2018 began as a small head and shoulders reversal pattern.
   * The drop in 2015 began with a triple top reversal pattern.
* The stock has since recovered from its -39% slide by gapping both the 50-day moving average and the 200-day moving average. 

## Report

Apple has gained more than 1,850% since 2009, but not without its rough patches. The stock has fallen more than 30% three times: -45% in 2012-2013; -31% between 2015-2016; and most recently -39% in 2018. Although the stock has lost a third of its value three times over the last 10 years, it has remained within a channel throughout the current bull market. Each of the drops began when the stock reached the upper channel resistance line, and ended on the channel support line. The stock has behaved like an example in a technical analysis book. 

In fact, the three times the stock peaked, there were also clear technical that the stock would sell-off. The first drop began when the stock was making new highs, but the indicators signaled a clear bearish divergence. The second drop began after a triple top reversal formed along the top of the channel. Third, the latest drop began along the channel resistance, and a small head and shoulders reversal pattern formed.   

The stock is still within its long-term channel, and this provides a few trading signals. First, if the stock ever falls below its long-term channel support, which is also the 200-weekly moving average, a sell signal is generated. If the stock were to break the support, it could signal an economic recession, and a cyclical bear market. AAPL is a very popular stock, and has a high positive correlation to the S&P 500 (250 day correlation of 0.81). So if the stock is falling out of the channel, then the rest of the market is probably falling into a downturn as well. 

Until the stock violates the channel, a buy signal is generated when the stock reaches the support. Supports should stop the stock from falling, and buying near a support has a great risk-to-reward ratio. A stop is placed just under the support line, in case the uptrend ends. We opened a position in our Technical Portfolios after the stock gapped away from the support line, indicating a successful test. 

Because the stock is a great example of technical analysis, there are simple moving average trades that can generate some good returns. A very common trade, the Golden Cross, generates a buy signal when the 50-day moving average crosses above the 200-day moving average. A sell signal is generated when the 50-day moving average crosses below the 200-day moving average. 

Finally, another great way to trade AAPL is to open a position when the price crosses above the 50-week moving average, and sell the position when it crosses below. Doing this, you would have bought around $16, then sold near $70 (these are split adjusted prices). A second purchase occurred around $65 with a sell around $105, and a third purchase at $102 with a sell near $180.

The stock has been a key part of many investor’s portfolios, but with good reason. The huge increase in the stock price since 2009 has drawn a lot of attention to the company and its stock. When investors are really fearful of the company, the economy, or both, then the stock will fall out of its channel. Until then, the stock should continue higher over the time.

594,594,2019-03-31,"WSJ: ‘Fear of Missing Out’ Pushes Investors Toward Stocks As major indexes continue to rise toward last year’s records, investors say they are increasingly wary of missing further gains

Optimism about trade talks and the Federal Reserve’s signaled halt to interest-rate increases propelled the S&P 500 to its best quarter since September 2009, even as investors wrestle with issues ranging from slowing global growth to uncertainties surrounding Brexit. As the rally has continued, powering major indexes toward last year’s records, investors say they are increasingly wary of missing out on further gains.

Stocks quickly stabilized last week after longer-term Treasury yields fell below those on shorter-term debt, a development known as an inverted yield curve that often presages a recession. The shift rattled markets briefly earlier in the month, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the quarter with a 1.7% weekly advance. One reason for the recovery: investors’ wagers that a U.S.-China trade agreement will stabilize the world economy, boosting corporate earnings.

Ed Leventhal, a 58-year old who manages a family investment office in New York, said he has been buying shares of some companies hurt by trade tensions such as Ford Motor Co.

“There’s no question we’re going to get some resolution to this,” Mr. Leventhal said. “There’s reason to believe that the U.S. economy will continue to do well.”

Investors this week expect to monitor trade discussions that could further swing markets, with U.S. and Chinese officials meeting in Washington. Manufacturing data and retail sales figures could also shift expectations for U.S. growth.

Many are also looking ahead to earnings season, which begins in earnest at the end of next week with reports from JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo & Co. S&P 500 companies are expected to report their first decline in quarterly profits from a year earlier since 2016.

Despite downbeat earnings projections for the January-March quarter, some investors have already grown increasingly optimistic following the Fed’s cautious shift. After investors pulled money from U.S. stock mutual and exchange-traded funds at the start of the year, more than $25 billion flowed in during the week ended March 13, the largest weekly inflow in a year, according to EPFR Global.

Investors withdrew money from such funds again during the weeks ended March 20 and 27, but they still increased their allocation to both stock funds and stocks in February, according to an American Association of Individual Investors survey. More than 80% of active traders say it is a good time to invest in U.S. stocks, a Charles Schwab survey found.

Some analysts say greater investor demand for stocks could join robust corporate buybacks in supporting major indexes. S&P 500 share repurchases in the fourth quarter rose to a record $223 billion, a 63% increase from a year earlier, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.

Buybacks make corporate profits appear stronger by lowering the number of shares outstanding, buoying per-share earnings beyond strong profit growth.

Some analysts remain confident stocks will rise even though the Fed recently lowered its economic growth projections for 2019. In response to the slowdown, the central bank signaled it likely won’t raise interest rates this year. Treasury yields, which fall when bond prices rise, have slumped to their lowest level in 15 months following the Fed statement.

At the same time, several said growth is slowing but sturdy, and a pause in interest-rate increases could still lift major indexes.

“There is that fear of missing out, which along with a tempered Fed creates the belief that we’re not going to be retesting those December lows,” said Leslie Thompson, managing principal at Spectrum Management Group.

Ms. Thompson said she has been buying shares of companies that pay higher dividends such as Darden Restaurants Inc., as well as technology stocks like Apple Inc.

After another weekly advance, the S&P 500 is up 13% for the year and sits just 3.3% below last September’s all-time high. Some analysts have been caught off guard by the durability of the early-year rally because S&P 500 companies are expected to report a nearly 4% drop in first-quarter earnings from a year earlier, according to FactSet.

Sectors that have led the market, such as technology, are expected to report double-digit percentage earnings declines. Even cyclical stocks tied to the health of the economy such as industrial and energy shares continue to power markets higher as growth slows, an illustration of the conflicting signals being sent by stock and bond markets.

Craig Hodges, portfolio manager for Hodges Funds, said he has been buying shares of faster-growing technology companies such as Twilio Inc., in addition to beaten-down materials firms including Commercial Metals Co.

“To me the backdrop is still pretty good,” Mr. Hodges said. “There have been a lot of excuses for the market to go down and it really hasn’t.”

With earnings estimates falling even as stocks surge, major indexes have gotten more expensive relative to companies’ earnings for the next 12 months. The price/earnings ratio of the S&P 500 based on profit estimates for the next year, a common valuation measure, just logged its largest one-quarter increase since June 2009, according to a Dow Jones Market Data analysis of figures through Thursday.

Still, some analysts say current valuations are appropriate following the fourth-quarter selloff and swift recovery. The steady nature of this year’s gains also continues to placate nervous investors.

The S&P 500 fell more than 1% in a session just three times in the first quarter, minimizing the outsize gyrations that made market observers so anxious late last year.

“People are trying to get really aggressive now,” said Benjamin Lau, chief investment officer of Apriem Advisors. “Clients do not want to miss out on the upswing in the market…The hard part is keeping their expectations in check.”

600,600,2019-04-16,"'China’s Netflix' is really an 'online Disney': iQiyi CEO >When Tim Yu Gong, the CEO of iQiyi, came to New York and Boston for a Non-Deal Roadshow in 2015, he found it “was very painful” to make U.S. investors understand what his company does.

>Three years later, as his Chinese video-streaming company backed by search engine giant Baidu was getting ready for a Nasdaq listing, Gong found his story had become much easier to tell. Video streaming had taken off in the U.S., and Netflix had become a Wall Street darling— its share price (NFLX) at around $350, had more than quadrupled within three years.
iQiyi (IQ) was the first Chinese video streaming site to go public in the U.S. so it naturally won the title of “China’s Netflix”. Its $2.4 billion IPO in March 2018 was the fourth-largest U.S. IPO last year and the biggest among 33 Chinese companies that went public in the U.S. American investors may have never used its product, but that didn’t stop them from betting on China’s online entertainment industry.
But Gong said iQiyi is so much more than just a streaming video service.

>“Our business model is quite different from Netflix, but to raise funds and make it easier for Western investors to understand, we call ourselves Netflix Plus at the time. The most accurate way to describe us would be ‘online Disney’,” Gong told Yahoo Finance in an interview. After a wild run, the stock has jumped by 54% in its first year in the public market, and grew 51% year-to-date. iQiyi shares have been holding up well among Chinese tech stocks, which have been hit by the U.S.-China trade tensions.

>Gong believes the company’s “Apple Garden”-like business model differentiates itself from Netflix’s “single model” — It’s expanding vertically within the Chinese market, trying to build an ecosystem on content and IP, such as literature, comics, light novels, and gaming. Unlike Netflix, it also offers ad-supported content free to users, whom the company hopes will become paid subscribers.

&#x200B;

If you missed yesterday's Tesla's Autonomy Investor event, watch the full presentation. If you don't understand it, try. If you still don't understand it, sorry.

&#x200B;

The stock didn't move, so I've loaded up.

&#x200B;

I'm not here to convince anyone of anything, but here are some questions to ask yourself:

&#x200B;

* Is Tesla's data lead (2 orders of magnitude and counting....360k vehicles on the road right now sending training data back to base at every driver intervention) unassailable?
* Does Tesla have the best, cheapest and most energy efficient self driving computer?
* Has Tesla built custom software for their custom hardware which will provide efficiencies no one else can match unless they too build their own full self driving (FSD) hardware and software?
* Will Tesla be first to achieve (FSD)?
* Will Tesla be first to gain regulatory approval for FSD?
* Is Tesla the ONLY vehicle manufacturer producing FSD-ready vehicles RIGHT NOW?
* Will Tesla's Model 3 drive train last 1 million+ miles?
* Will the new battery (next year) last 1 million+ miles?
* Will Uber, Lyft, Waymo raise capital and run at enormous losses so they can cut their ride costs by 100-200% to compete with the Tesla robo taxis, or will they begin building or buying their own vehicles. If so, who from?
* What will happen to the value of existing vehicles on the road when Tesla achieves FSD?
* What will happen to company valuations of ICE manufacturers who haven't transitioned ALL new vehicles to electric AND full self driving when the first EV manufacturer achieves FSD?
* What will happen to Tesla's net profit when they ""turn on"" their robo taxi fleet, taking 25-30% of all user-owned rides, and 100% of all Tesla-owned rides? Approx cashflow analysis suggests a $38,000 (retail) Model 3 will generate $30,000/yr in the fleet, and last 10 years. **READ THAT AGAIN**. A $38,000 asset (built for less, but consumers can buy for that) can ROI \~80% in year 1.... year 2 and beyond is pure cream.
* Did Tesla executed on EVERYTHING in the ""Secret Tesla Master Plan"" of 2006 ( [https://www.tesla.com/blog/secret-tesla-motors-master-plan-just-between-you-and-me](https://www.tesla.com/blog/secret-tesla-motors-master-plan-just-between-you-and-me) )?
* Is Tesla on the way to executing EVERYTHING in Master Plan Part Deux ([https://www.tesla.com/BLOG/MASTER-PLAN-PART-DEUX](https://www.tesla.com/BLOG/MASTER-PLAN-PART-DEUX))?
* Who is poised to produce an equivalent or better vehicle at scale?

(People buy because of emotion and justify with logic) So I see the robotaxi leading to more tesla sales and cash flow generation from commissions to tesla. 

This being said, I do agree with most people who say the robotaxi program will likely be delayed and it'll be hard to get the government to allow this.

## The Report

Click here to read/download the report and see the charts:  [https://www.brtechnicals.com/netflix-nflx-technical-analysis-stock-report/](https://www.brtechnicals.com/netflix-nflx-technical-analysis-stock-report/) 

Netflix started out as a competitor to movie rental stores. In their beginning, Netflix mailed DVDs to customers upon request, and they were essentially a movie rental company that worked through the mail. Eventually, they became a video streaming company, and really became disruptors of the media industry. After successfully shutting down movie rental stores, Netflix started to compete with cable companies and TV providers with their video streaming service. Now, in addition to movie rentals and content streaming, they are also content producers with their Netflix Original content placed directly onto their platform. This has really changed the media industry as more companies are starting to provide self-made content, disrupting the old ways of Hollywood and traditional media companies. 

NFLX has made substantial gains since their IPO, and its not without good reason. They have already taken down the likes of Blockbuster, and they continue to disrupt other industries. Investors have rewarded the company with high stock prices and strong optimism. The stock moved from $1.50 all the way up to a peak of $420. If you bought 10,000 shares at the adjusted $1.50 price, your $15,000 position would have been worth $4.2 million at the peak. Unfortunately, returns like this spark a warning that this stock may be an asset bubble.

### NFLX is Bubbly

I have previously written about NFLX, and my belief that the stock is an asset bubble. High liquidity has helped the economy grow since the Great Recession, but there are always consequences when the market is interfered with. I think NFLX has become a bubble because of the high optimism surrounding the company. A couple of years ago there weren’t many competitors to NFLX, the closest was Amazon’s Prime Video streaming service. Now, AT&T is producing its own content and streaming it, and they also have an internet cable stream for live TV. Hulu, Amazon, Apple, and Disney are all now becoming direct competitors to NFLX, in every facet of Netflix’s business. The 135 P/E ratio, as of today’s close (5/1/2019), may no longer be warranted.

### Overbought & Reversal Patterns

NFLX broke out of 17-year old channel in 2018. This is a sign that the stock is overbought, like the overbought line on the RSI indicator. Additionally, the stock created one of the most recognized reversal patterns while outside the channel, the head and shoulders. When these two signals are coupled together, it provides a strong argument that the stock has peaked this cycle. I will not be buying at these levels.  

# Netflix Technical Analysis

## NFLX Long-Term Technical Analysis

*  NFLX has been in a channel since its IPO, but recently breached the top of it.
   * The stock eventually fell back below the channel resistance, but is currently testing it again.
   * A breakout here could provide support for a continued uptrend.
* Netflix stock has made remarkable returns since its IPO.
   * On this adjusted chart, it has moved from $1.50 and peaked at $420.
      * Most of the returns have come since 2013. 

## NFLX 10-Year Technical Analysis

*  Since 2013, NFLX has been in a minor trend within the large channel.
* Volatility really picked up in 2018.
   * The MACD indicator has moved from 20 down to -15.
* RSI and MACD are moving downwards, but the stock has moved higher.
   * This is a bearish divergence, and it tells us the stock is losing momentum. 

## NFLX Medium-Term Technical Analysis

* This is a closer look at the minor channel from the chart above.
* The top green dashed line represents a key level.
   * The stock tends to use this line as a reversal point.
* NFLX looks like it was in a head & shoulders pattern above the green dashed. The line is the neckline.
* Looking at the 20-year chart, the stock broke out above the long-term channel, and formed into a head and shoulders pattern.
   * Is this the peak? 

## NFLX Short-Term Technical Analysis

* This is a closer look at the head and shoulders pattern.
* The neckline is sloped.
* After breaking out below the neckline, the stock fell from $420 down to $250, a -40% decline.
   * This is a successful head and shoulders, but it didn’t signal a long-term trend, which we might expect.
* Now the stock is testing the neckline once again, and I think this could tell us the stock is reaching resistance, and is ready to fall again.
* The neckline is also the long-term channel top from the 20-year chart.

* Produced 77,100 total vehicles, +123% YoY

* Reaffirm guidance of 360,000 to 400,000 vehicle deliveries in 2019.
* May be able to produce as many as 500,000 vehicles globally in 2019.
* Being able to produce over 500,000 vehicles globally in the 12-month period ending June 30, 2020 does appear very likely.

* Deliveries in North America during Q1 will be lower than the prior quarter as we start delivering cars in Europe and China for the first time. As a result of the start of Model 3 expansion into Europe and China, deliveries will be lower than production by about 10,000 units due to vehicle transit times to these markets.

* Q1 financials will reflect a one-time restructuring cost.
* The gap between production and deliveries in Q1 will create a temporary but predictable dip in our revenues and earnings.
* Target is to achieve a very small GAAP net income in Q1.
* The higher in-transit inventory will also negatively impact operating cash flows in Q1.
* Deliver 360,000 to 400,000 vehicles in 2019.
* Capital expenditure is expected to be about $2.5 billion.

[Tesla Gigafactory 3’s rise shows that it’s too early to dismiss Elon Musk’s ‘sci-fi projects’ | May 20 2019](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-gigafactory-3-china-rises-elon-musk-sci-fi-projects/)

A drone flyover of Gigafactory 3 on Monday has revealed that the factory shell of Tesla’s China-based electric car production facility is all but complete. Only a few small sections of the massive general assembly building do not have roofing yet, and the same is true for Gigafactory 3’s walls. Around the facility’s grounds, workers continued their activities, and cement trucks were seen heading inside the massive factory, hinting at the work being started inside.  The pace of Gigafactory 3’s construction is unprecedented, and it is one that will likely make it to books in the future. China itself, which holds a solid reputation for quick, surgically-precise buildouts, will probably set records with the construction of Gigafactory 3. As Tesla’s electric car factory in Shanghai rises, it is pertinent to note that there was a time, not too long ago, when the idea of Gigafactory 3’s factory shell being completed in roughly five months was considered implausible.

Tesla will push an updated Autopilot in Europe that scales back on a couple of functions in order to comply with new regulations. The changes will require faster lane changes and limit how far you can turn the steering wheel on Autosteer. Electrek reports that while Tesla's Autopilot was approved under older rules, it had to be dialed back in order to comply with the new UN/ECE R79 regulation on driver assistance systems. The update only impacts Model S and Model X vehicles; Model 3 already complies with the new rules.

The massive amount of real-world data gathered from our cars’ eight cameras, 12 ultrasonic sensors, and forward-facing radar, coupled with billions of miles of inputs from real drivers, helps us better understand the patterns to watch out for in the moments before a crash. As our quarterly safety reports have shown, drivers using Autopilot register fewer accidents per mile than those driving without it. That’s because Autopilot is designed to reduce fatigue by helping drivers stay in their lane, while also ensuring that they keep their hands on the wheel. While lane-keeping and hands-on monitoring can be extremely effective at helping to reduce the likelihood of an accident when Autopilot is in use, we believe that these precautions can also be extremely effective for preventing accidents when Autopilot is not in use. Today, we’re introducing two new safety features designed to help prevent drivers from inadvertently departing their lane, which our data shows is a common cause of accidents when Autopilot is not in use. These new features – Lane Departure Avoidance and Emergency Lane Departure Avoidance – help drivers stay engaged and in their lane in order to avoid collisions.

[Elon Musk Makes $500 Billion Autonomy Pitch to Investors | May 2 2019](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-05-02/musk-is-said-to-make-500-billion-autonomy-pitch-to-investors)

The chief executive officer said autonomy is a fundamental driver for Tesla and key to how it could become a “half-trillion dollar market cap company,” said the people, who asked not to be identified because the call wasn’t open to the public. A Tesla spokesman didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. The comments build on the case that Musk made during an investor day focused on autonomy last week that Tesla is on the cusp of having 1 million vehicles on the road that will be fully capable of driving themselves. The billionaire plans to put those cars into a shared robotaxi service that the CEO described as being lucrative for both the company and its customers.

[Tesla delays electric semi truck production to next year | Apr 25th 2019](https://electrek.co/2019/04/25/tesla-semi-delay-electric-truck-production-next-year/)

During its first quarter 2019 earnings call last night, Tesla confirmed that it is delaying the production of Tesla Semi, its electric semi truck program, to next year. The executive also said that they are currently testing the electric trucks with maximum loads and that they are making improvements to the design. Musk previously said that Tesla aims to manufacture 100,000 electric trucks per year. Over the past two years, Tesla has been taking reservations for the electric truck and said that the production versions will have 300-mile and 500-mile range versions for $150,000 and $180,000 respectively.

[The Longest-Range Electric Vehicle Now Goes Even Farther | April 23 2019](https://www.tesla.com/blog/longest-range-electric-vehicle-now-goes-even-farther)

Beginning today, Model S and Model X now come with an all-new drivetrain design that increases each vehicle’s range substantially, achieving a landmark 370 miles and 325 miles on the EPA cycle for Model S and Model X Long Range, respectively. Using the same 100 kWh battery pack, these design and architecture updates will allow drivers to travel farther than ever before, charging less frequently and getting more range out of every dollar spent on charging. We’re also introducing a brand-new adaptive suspension system for Model S and Model X, along with a few other improvements for the best range, acceleration, and ride comfort ever, plus a Ludicrous Mode upgrade for our most loyal customers.

[Elon Musk said Tesla cars will probably be better than humans at driving by the end of 2019 | Apr 17 2019](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-predicts-tesla-cars-better-than-humans-at-driving-by-end-of-2019-2019-4?utm_source=feedly&utm_medium=referral)

Tesla vehicles will likely be better at driving than humans by the end of 2019, CEO Elon Musk said in an interview with MIT research scientist Lex Fridman. ""I think it will become very quickly — maybe even towards the end of this year, but I would say I'd be shocked if it's not next year, at the latest — that having a human intervene will decrease safety,"" Musk said. Musk later said that Tesla's autonomous-driving technology was improving at an exponential rate, and that it seemed to him that the company is ahead of its competitors in the autonomous-driving industry.

[Introducing a More Seamless Navigate on Autopilot | April 3, 2019](https://www.tesla.com/blog/introducing-more-seamless-navigate-autopilot?utm_campaign=NoA&utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social)

Since we first introduced Navigate on Autopilot last year, Tesla drivers have traveled more than 66 million miles using the feature, and more than 9 million suggested lane changes have been successfully executed with the feature in use. Today, we’re beginning to roll out our latest version of Navigate on Autopilot for a more seamless active guidance experience. In this new version, drivers will now have the option to use Navigate on Autopilot without having to confirm lane changes via the turn stalk.

[Musk Hints Tesla Pickup Truck Will Make Ram Seem ""Puny"" | Mar 31, 2019](https://insideevs.com/news/343601/musk-hints-tesla-pickup-truck-will-make-ram-seem-puny/)

Of course, we need some context here to explain what Musk is referring to, so here's the tweets:@RamLover69 You would still be physically fatigued if you tried to haul 12,000 lbs of steel beams like I do every day with my Dodge Ram, 2019s motor trend truck of the year.@elonmusk 12,000 lbs!? How puny. Do you construct children’s toys?It's not a secret that Tesla is working on an electric pickup truck. In fact, it's scheduled to be revealed sometime later this year. As for its towing/hauling abilities, both are still up in the air. However, we do know that the expectations are high...very high. The truck will be a dual-motor, all-wheel-drive pickup with ""crazy torque & a suspension that dynamically adjusts for load. Those will be standard,"" noted Musk in a previous tweet. We suspect that whatever a Ram 1500 or Ford F-150 can do, Tesla will one-up those figures.

[Musk Says Tesla \`Would Love to Be' in India This Year or Next | March 15 2019](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-15/musk-says-tesla-would-love-to-be-in-india-this-year-or-next)

Elon Musk isn’t giving up on bringing Tesla Inc. to India. “Would love to be there this year. If not, definitely next!” Tesla’s billionaire chief executive officer said in a Twitter post, nearly ten months after he blamed restrictive policy for delaying the carmaker’s entry into the world’s fourth largest automobile market.

[Tesla Model Y announced: release set for 2020, price starts at $47,000 | Mar 14 2019](https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/14/18264446/tesla-model-y-suv-compact-announcement-price-release-date-features-elon-musk)

The specs weren’t much of a surprise either: the long-range Model Y has a range of 300 miles and seating for seven. A performance version of the vehicle is capable of sprinting from 0 to 60 mph in 3.5 seconds. “It has the functionality of an SUV, but it will ride like a sports car,” Musk said. “So this thing will be really tight on corners.” The $47,000 long-range Model Y will come first in the fall of 2020, and it will have a range of 300 miles, Musk said. Tesla will also sell an all-wheel drive dual-motor version for $51,000 and a performance version for $60,000 — both of which will be available in fall 2020. The cheaper, standard range version with a range of 230 miles won’t be available until 2021, Musk said. It will sell for $39,000.

[Introducing V3 Supercharging | March 6 2019](https://www.tesla.com/blog/introducing-v3-supercharging)

Tesla has more than 12,000 Superchargers across North America, Europe, and Asia and our network continues to grow daily: more than 99% of the U.S. population is covered by the network, and we anticipate similar coverage in Europe by the end of 2019. Recently, we passed 90% population coverage in China and are growing that number quickly. V3 is a completely new architecture for Supercharging. A new 1MW power cabinet with a similar design to our utility-scale products supports peak rates of up to 250kW per car. At this rate, a Model 3 Long Range operating at peak efficiency can recover up to 75 miles of charge in 5 minutes and charge at rates of up to 1,000 miles per hour. Combined with other improvements we’re announcing today, V3 Supercharging will ultimately cut the amount of time customers spend charging by an average of 50%, as modeled on our fleet data.

[Tesla’s Model 3 was the best-selling EV in the world last year | Feb 22 2019](https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/22/18236707/tesla-model-3-2018-best-selling-ev-global)

The Tesla Model 3 was the best-selling electric car in the world in 2018, according to data firm JATO Dynamics. JATO says the Silicon Valley automaker sold about 138,000 Model 3s, beating out contenders like the flagship EV of state-owned Chinese automaker BAIC (92,000) and the Nissan Leaf (85,000). In total, Tesla sold more EVs than any other automaker in 2018, JATO reports. The news comes at the same time that Tesla is starting deliveries of the Model 3 in China, the largest market in the world for electric cars. Tesla also recently started delivering Model 3s in Europe for the first time ever. Adding those new markets for the Model 3 is supposed to help Tesla increase sales of the car by more than 100,000 in 2019, according to recent estimates from the company.

[Sentry Mode: Guarding Your Tesla | February 13 2019](https://www.tesla.com/blog/sentry-mode-guarding-your-tesla)

According to federal statistics, there was an estimated one motor vehicle theft or attempted theft every 40.8 seconds in the United States in 2017— and that doesn’t even include the vast number of car break-ins that happen nationwide. Sentry Mode adds a unique layer of protection to Tesla vehicles by continuously monitoring the environment around a car when it’s left unattended. When enabled, Sentry Mode enters a “Standby” state, like many home alarm systems, which uses the car’s external cameras to detect potential threats. If a minimal threat is detected, such as someone leaning on a car, Sentry Mode switches to an “Alert” state and displays a message on the touchscreen warning that its cameras are recording. If a more severe threat is detected, such as someone breaking a window, Sentry Mode switches to an “Alarm” state, which activates the car alarm, increases the brightness of the center display, and plays music at maximum volume from the car’s audio system. If a car switches to “Alarm” state, owners will also receive an alert from their Tesla mobile app notifying them that an incident has occurred. They’ll be able to download a video recording of an incident (which begins 10 minutes prior to the time a threat was detected) by inserting a formatted USB drive into their car before they enable Sentry Mode.

To: Everybody

As of yesterday, we had over 50,000 net new orders for this quarter. Based on current trends, we have a good chance of exceeding the record 90,700 deliveries of Q4 last year and making this the highest deliveries/sales quarter in Tesla history!

In order to achieve this, we need sustained output of 1,000 Model 3’s per day. Almost all parts of the Model 3 production system have exceeded 1000 units on multiple days (congratulations!!) and we’ve averaged about 900/day this week, so we’re only about 10% away from 7000/week.

If we rally hard, we can do it!

648,648,2019-07-05,"I get why people have been high on $MSFT leading up to recently, but even with Azure's growth, aren't they already priced to perfection? After being on here for the past year, it seems the community thinks of $MSFT as a no brainer. Though, when you look under the hood and how it is currently priced, I'd have to say that it may be one I'd stay away from.

&#x200B;

I work in the SaaS industry, and I can confidently say that all of our most transformative clients all choose AWS over Azure. Azure is viewed more as a legacy infrastructure, one that configures easily with .NET applications. Almost as if the ""safe"" option rather than one that can transform how a company looks at its infrastructure. The reason I bring this up is because it demonstrates the loyalty factor with Azure vs AWS: people go to AWS because they believe in the vision of being ""best in class"". People go to Azure as a cost efficient, safe bet. 

&#x200B;

Which do you think is stickier?

&#x200B;

And, if you look at $MSFT's history, besides their operating system, they have copied an existing a competitive solution/product and brought it to market to gain market share. (Bing, Zune, Xbox, Surface, Microsoft phone.., etc) This is not a company that prides itself on innovation, but rather a company that won the OS battle early and, arguably through predatory actions, maintained it through the rise of the internet. This caused them to be sticky within the tech scene for years and so have utilized their high margins to stay afloat by copying transformative tech.

&#x200B;

Enough with sentiment, here are the biggest fundamentals that scare me:

PEG: 2.02

PE: 30.17

Dividend Payout Ratio: 39.11% (Way too high for competitive tech industry)

Azure's Market Share: 16% (AWS: 33%)

&#x200B;

(TL;DR) So all in all, you get an objectively overvalued, 2nd rate company that pays out nearly 40% of it's earnings in dividends, which holds it back from fully re-investing into future tech revolutions.

660,660,2019-07-18,"Help Me Understand NFLX How can they have positive earnings but incredibly negative FCF?  It looks like their spending on content is completely independent of ""cost of goods sold"", essentially as ian nvestment rather than an ongoing expense.

My understanding of stocks is heavily rooted in automobiles and semiconductors.  There, R&D is a huge expense, for semiconductors moreso than autos.  Intel, AMD, Qualcomm and Nvidia all subtract their absolutely massive R&D expenditures from their equally massive gross margins (AMD's margins were unsustainable bad at less than 40%, Intel is doing well at better than 50%), but their earnings are nowhere near that high because the EPS already has the R&D subtracted out.

Semiconductor companies cannot survive on their back catalogs, and massive R&D spending is an ongoing necessity.  While it is not a cost of sales line item, it comes out of revenue before earnings.  Similarly, NFLX cannot survive on its back catalog (i.e. binge watching Stranger Things 1-3...in 2027) at least not at anything like its present valuation.  That is even more true with competitors pulling third party content back onto their own, new streaming platforms while continuing to produce new, competitive content.

From that angle, I would argue that while there may be some justification for how NFLX calculates EPS, the way that they do it excludes a massive line item that they cannot reduce without tanking revenue.  Therefore, by their accounting standards, EPS is virtually meaningless while FCF is the only metric that matters.  NFLX seems less like a profitable company with international subscriber growth issues and domestic market saturation and more like a company that is literally hemorrhaging capital in a model that will never generate actual profits.

661,661,2019-07-18,"Can someone lay out the bull case for NFLX? Disclaimer: I own no position in Netflix currently but held a short position over earnings that was obviously profitable. 

I don’t understand the bull case here. Its P/E is over 100, which I understand can be justified by 1) the fact that most revenue is being reinvested in the company for future growth (see AMD) or 2) there is an anticipated huge amount of growth in the future. Usually it’s a combination of both. 

With Netflix, do we have either? It seems that Netflix has such a high spending budget because it invests in original content and licenses other shows. But unlike companies that invest in infrastructure and equipment, if Netflix wants to stay relevant, it must continue to do these things. It would be decades before Netflix has enough original content to get rid of the other stuff, and I’m not convinced it would be as popular without it.

In addition, do we really see massive growth from here? It seems that most people who want Netflix have Netflix, hence the drop in domestic growth, and that it just doesn’t have the same appeal internationally (hence the disappointing numbers). If you travel, you know that nobody consumes streaming TV like Americans. We will never see comparable adoption abroad.

662,662,2019-07-18,"Netflix - The case for continued decline Down 11% after earnings. Horrible new subscriber numbers. 

IMO, NFLX will continue to tank into the low 200s. It might dead cat bounce here and there but the trend going in 2019 and 2020 is down. 

Facts and Opinions

-	It’s US subscription base is saturated. It’s the most stable, profitable. To increase revenue in the US, Netflix has to increase monthly price. This will be a further hit on new subs and current subs. 

-	Foreign markets continue to see higher percentage growth. No necessarily a great thing. There’s huge marketing and support costs in trying to penetrate these new territories. This is cash burn hell. 

-	Even with the 11% haircut. PE is at 125. CEO keeps saying it’s a media company not a tech company. Well, Hasting, DIS PE is 15. Please explain why your media company is 8 times more expansive then the best media company in the world that, by the way, will own HULU outright and will launch Disney+. NFLX fair value as a media company is 40-50 dollars. Let’s add a 4x multiple for its “growth story”.  Then it’s 200 per share. Not 300+

-	It’s business model just does not work. Debt to equity ratio is 1.8. They have a burn rate of 3.5B in 2019 and more of the same in 2020. And for what? It’s mostly spent on content. Besides OITNB, HOC, and Stranger Things, it has not generated many franchises. Disney creates the best content franchises of anyone and it still cannot guarantee a hit. Content is not scalable or predictable. NFLX BURN RATE WILL HAVE TO INCREASE NOT DECREASE. Once Friends and the Office leave, they need their own mega-hits. No guarantees there. 

-	Streaming was innovative and convenient 10 years ago. It’s taken for granted now. NFLX has no most. No tech advantage.

I am planning on getting 10 contracts (about 40K) for Apple 230 June 2021 call at 19 or so. My reasoning for optimism is the Apple Card. 

I travel for business within the US. For the last few weeks, I have been noticing how many people use iPhone vs other devices. Almost every state I visited more people use iPhone and only half of them half Apple Watch (growth potential). 

Here is where the card comes in. They already have the customer base using their devices. I am sure they will make it easier or enticing to get the card.

One of the key aspect of the card is that Apple can use that data to market better services. (Part of the agreement of the card). That means competing with companies like yelp etc - based on your spending habits Apple can target advertise - you are where you spend your money, great marketing. 

Of course the other business growth can be tied to these services. Apple is spending over 4 billion in R&D. Something big would have to come out of that. 

What are your thoughts? Good idea, don’t do

679,679,2019-08-07,"Is there any direction for NFLX to go but down in the coming years? INTENSE competition arising in the next 1-2 years. WarnerMedia, NBC and Disney all launching their own respective streaming services. NFLX missing MASSIVELY on subscriber growth last quarter after two great quarters mainly driven by price increases. 

With more and more streaming services coming out, the pickings get slimmer on Netflix and they have to rely on their own content, which continues to burn hundreds of millions for them in production costs, and the reality is that most of the shows that Netflix claims to be their drivers (Orange is the New Black, The Crown) are forgettable to anyone except people who began watching them years ago, and ultimately when they end, the incentive to stay with the service after already having watched the shows will decrease. 

Netflix likely won’t be able to increase prices anymore (which was a main driver of their huge revenue these last two quarters) without it hitting their subscriber base dramatically as the new Disney+, ESPN+ and Hulu (with ads) bundle at $12.99 is debuting at the SAME PRICE as the current most popular Netflix deal. As Netflix loses more and more content, pricing models become exponentially more competitive and streaming service options quadruple, is there any way for Netflix to go but down?

681,681,2019-08-11,"""Strike it big stocks for the next decade"", a serious approach. Yesterday there was a big thread about this, but very few of the answers actually tried to answer the question seriously.

I believe there are three ways companies strike it big:

1) **They invent (or seriously flesh out) and market a new technology**. Think Edison's light bulb. This is the most risky type of investments. Most inventions turn out to be either impossible to create at the time (Theranos, HDSN - if we talk publicly traded), impractical to produce at scale (many ""in 5 years"" technologies that you see in the media) or fail to find consumers (did you know Sears had an online service that offered social media, search engine and an online shop in the late 80s?). Even those that actually scale those three obstacles may not really strike it big and become a niche product (Segway). So extremely risky. The sectore with where most of the invention of new technologies is going on is pharmacology, biotech and material sciences. 

2) **They bring a niche or luxury product/service to the masses**. Think Ford's cars. This is a bit less risky as we are not talking about a possible Theranos/HDSN style failure. It may still fail to scale the production or reach a market though. I think currently there are a lot of ventures that are bringing processes that used to be the domain of big companies to tiny companies. Think Salesforce, Square or Shopify. 

3) **Make an existing service/product much more efficient than any of the competitors**. Think Walmart or South West Airlines. This is even less risky than the previous two - the product or service exists, and is highly marketable, you ""only"" have to be able to implement your more efficient strategy. A lot of the cloud-using companies are like this because they can scale their customers much more easily - Zoom Video for instance, MongoDB, Okta etc.

New York(CNN Business) Just about every time Ford Motor makes big news, some investors mistakenly buy shares of Forward Industries, a tiny maker of carrying cases for medical monitoring systems and other electronic devices.

That's because Forward Industries (FORD), which is worth just $10 million, trades under the ticker symbol ""FORD."" The iconic Ford Motor (F) has the ticker symbol of ""F.""

HP confuses investors too. When either of the two tech companies that were part of the original Hewlett Packard tech conglomerate are in the news, shares of oil services company Helmerich & Payne (HP), which actually trades under the ticker symbol ""HP,"" often moves in the same direction. PC company HP's ticker symbol is ""HPQ"" while Hewlett Packard Enterprises trades under ""HPE.""

720,720,2019-10-18,"Morgan Stanley Is Bullish on Microsoft Because IT Departments Love It Microsoft has a key ally in its fight for business as companies move more software to the cloud: the people who run corporate information-technology departments.

In a Thursday note, Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss reiterated his confidence in Microsoft’s (ticker: MSFT) future, based on the bank’s latest survey of companies’ IT heads. Although uncertainty about the economy has weighed on companies’ 2020 budgets for technology, according to the survey, Microsoft remains well positioned.

About 36% of the executives surveyed said that they prefer Microsoft for the management of their hybrid cloud environments. That puts the company ahead of the runner-up—Amazon.com’s (AMZN) Amazon Web Services—by 9 percentage points.

A hybrid cloud system is one that combines software run on a company’s premises with whatever it operates in the cloud, whether via a firm’s own gear, or through a third party. Cloud management is the process of controlling all of that.

Microsoft’s machine-learning and artificial-intelligence business has also been growing head-to-head with Amazon over the past three years, taking market share from the previous leader, IBM’s (IBM) Watson, according to Weiss.
At the same time, Microsoft has been able to maintain its leadership in the productivity-software market via the dominant Microsoft Office suite. Many of its clients are planning to migrate to the cloud version—Office 365—over the next few years, he said.

Even for workplace collaboration systems, about 40% of the surveyed executives said they are currently using Microsoft Team as their standard tool, much higher than the 7% for Slack Technologies (WORK) and 6% for Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Google Hangout Chat. All three tools are expected to see strong growth over the next three years.

“Amidst an increasingly unsettled IT spending environment, these data points bolster our confidence in the durability of Microsoft’s commercial business and the potential for further leverage in the model,” wrote Weiss. He believes Microsoft will be able to win a bigger share of enterprises’ tech budget and deliver durable double-digit revenue growth, as more companies shift their digital operations to the cloud.

Microsoft shares have rallied 37% this year—largely driven by investor optimism about the company’s Azure cloud business—and trade at $140 per share as of Thursday’s close, just slightly below their record high, reached in July. The software giant will report its September quarter earnings next week and Wall Street is upbeat, estimating earnings will jump by 11% from the year-ago period to reach $1.24 per share.

Weiss reiterated his Overweight rating for the stock with a $155 price target, saying Microsoft is his top pick in the software industry. He expects the Azure cloud business will grow by 63% in the September quarter as compared with last year, and that the company’s total earnings be in line with the Wall Street consensus.

&nbsp;

Half a year has passed since the post. I continued to purchase $TSLA stock throughout April and May 2019. My thesis has not changed, nor my conviction. Tesla continue to execute their plans. I am holding long-term but I wanted to provide an update, and a prediction (see further down).

&nbsp;

Just so everyone's clear: I've been acquiring Tesla stock since early 2016. It's just that 6 months ago, I found myself facepalming so hard at how much analysts, media and ""investors"" were missing or just had plain wrong. I'm an opportunistic investor. I saw opportunity but didn't have much cash so instead of buying with savings, I nuked most of my stock portfolio and bought more Tesla.

&nbsp;

The stock is $316.73 as I type this on the back of strong Q3 results.

&nbsp;

**Results:**

&nbsp;

|Purchased|Cost Basis|Gain/Loss|
:--|:--|:--|
|22-Apr-2019|$264.17|+19.90%|
|23-Apr-2019|$262.04|+20.87%|

|31-May-2019|$185.41|+70.83%|
|31-May-2019|$185.49|+70.75%|

&nbsp;

**Predictions:**

&nbsp;

- Short squeeze underway.

&nbsp;

- Q4 2019 results will be bonkers. Record everything that matters including net profit, production, deliveries, gross margins. This is so obvious it hurts.

&nbsp;

- By Q4 2020, Giga 3 should be fully ramped, Giga Europe will be under construction, annual output over 500,000, over $5 billy in the bank.

&nbsp;

- Unless Elon drops LSD with Joe Rogan very soon, this is probably the last time we'll see the stock under $300.

&nbsp;

- Stock will continue on a bumpy, upward trajectory throughout the 2020s.

&nbsp;

Don't buy the stock because of this post BUT if you have questions about Tesla and why I am comfortable for that one single company to make up the majority of my stock portfolio, go for it. I'll do my best to answer.

Google (GOOG) has agreed to acquire wearable technology company, Fitbit, in a deal worth approximately $2.1 billion. The purchase of Fitbit (FIT) gives Google some real firepower in the fight to take-on industry leaders like Apple (AAPL), which has dominated the wearable space ever since the release of its Apple Watch in 2015.

“It's less of a hardware play on the trackers and on the smartwatches but really a data play... Google will now have information on not only the temperature of my house, to the extent I've got four Nest thermostats or whether or not I have a smoke alarm going off or things like that, they'll know, in fact, how much I move on a given day, how many steps I take, things of that nature,” D.A. Davidson analyst Tom Forte told Yahoo Finance. “This is very interesting data for Google. And if you think about Google's efforts, again, Amazon with Alexa and Apple with its various devices, they're all just collecting data for consumers. But this helps round out the data set for Google, given that it gives you, again, health care-related data.”

”By acquiring this company, it has access to a tremendous amount of health and fitness data that it can use to improve its own products and produce new ones that are hopefully going to continue to drive that Fitbit brand as something that is and remains competitive in this market,” said Holly. “Apple is more than a market leader in this place.

2)holding the stock until it gets higher so selling at 120$ for example would give me 20 bucks profit per share. (Please fix me if I understood it wrong)

750,750,2019-12-06,"[DD] Netflix - Curtain Close Let's have a deep look at our favourite junk bond financed content creator - shall we?

What is - by far - the most important metric people will look at when **NFLX** opens their books on January 15 is subscriber growth - particulary in the US. Conveniently (for **NFLX)**, that is exactly the one thing investors won't be able to see, since **NFLX** changes its reporting structure. Formerly, **NFLX** reported its numbers as *DOMESTIC v INTERNATIONAL* \- in the future there will be five world regions. While on the one hand, there is indeed more transparency, on the other hand US numbers will need to be estimated. This is important, because the US numbers indicate what **NFLX** can achieve in mature markets. 

Anyway, here is my take on UCAN (USA + Canada) subscriber numbers: **They will decrease.** I do not claim that **NFLX** users will massively switch to Disney+ or other competitors. But they don't need to. The numbers will still be disastrous. **NFLX** has a churn rate of 9-10% per quarter (that is the amount of users unsubscribing). This is actually pretty good. The problem for **NFLX** lies in the new or re-subscriber numbers. Since there are competitors now, massively cheaper priced, **NFLX** will not be the first choice to subscribe to for people anymore. **DIS** has been acquiring licenses for movies and series for the past two years - and the main driver for users to decide for one service over the other is their collection of classic movies and series - not the new stuff. People want to rewatch stuff - and that is something they can hardly do on **NFLX** anymore. Also, **AMZN** or **DIS** or **AAPL** each have more to offer than ""just"" movies and series. They benefit from cross- and up-selling and are not 100% dependent on streaming revenues. Unlike **NFLX**.

""OK"", you might say, ""those are all assumptions"". True - but I've also got some numbers for you. Let's look at **CAC** \- **C**ustomer **A**cquisition **C**ost. These can be calculated by dividing gross added subscriptions by marketing spend. I've taken the numbers from the **NFLX** reports. I've assumed a churn rate of 9%. And - most importantly - I've added the **netCAC** \- which uses net added subscriptions. Numbers, apart from **CAC** and **netCAC** are in thousands. Table is for the US market.  


||Q1 2018|Q2 2018|Q3 2018|Q4 2018|Q1 2019|Q2 2019|Q3 2019|

|Gross add|7.030|5.830|6.034|6.655|7.007|5.295|5.926|

|netCAC|$110.11|$288.19|$211.02|$204.54|$126.82|($1988.94)|$409.66|

**NFLX** business is pretty seasonal. Usually, the first quarter is the most efficient while during summer people tend to subscribe less. While the **CAC** on a quarter-to-quarter basis only increased a little, you can see massive increases in **netCAC**. In Q2 2019 Netflix was unable to sustain their paid memberships - even without any additional competition. The reason was a price increase which led to an increased churn rate, which - quoting their Q3 2019 report - has not returned yet to its original value. 

Thanks to the new competitors, there is no reason at all why it should go down one bit. If anything, it will increase. If it stays at 9%, churn will be 5.456.000 lost subscriptions, at 10% 6.062.000 and at 12% 7.274.000. Now look at the gross add. In each of the quarters, gross add was less than in 2018. According to **NFLX** own forecast, we look at 61.220.000 paid subscriptions at the end of Q4, equal to 600.000 net add subscriptions. Considering Q4 2017 (1.465.000, not in table) and Q4 2018 (1.529.000) this is already pretty low. 

We also know that according to **NFLX** own reporting, marketing spend will be more weighted towards Q4 2019 this fiscal year. Let's just assume, in order to have a lower bound for our estimates, that it is just the same as in Q4 2018 - $312 million. This would mean **netCACs** of $512.23. That is a 150% increase over Q4 2018. And remember - that is the lower bound. Now we know that there are competitors, which will compete for the same ad placements, where their marketing is most efficient. Then, in general, marketing prices increase on the biggest platforms. Lastly, this extremely important quarter for **NFLX** coincides with Christmas, meaning even higher marketing cost. 

If we assume $400 million marketing spend in the US in Q4 2019 - which in my humble opinion should be quite realistic, if not still a little bit on the lower side, **netCAC** increases up to $666.67. Per user. Now what does a user bring in revenue? According to **NFLX** itself, Q4 2019 domestic revenue is expected to be $2.455 million - that is $24.93 per user. Divide **netCAC** by this figure, you'll end up with 26.7 quarters that a user needs to be subscribed to **NFLX** just to recoup his or her original marketing spend. At these marginal cost there is only one thing to conclude: **NFLX** cannot grow domestically in a sustainable way anymore. Even if we take the lower bound figure, it still takes more than 20 quarters for a user to break even. And that is only break even considering marketing. Which is a smooth transition to the next point: content.

By far the biggest drivers of cost for **NFLX** are content creation and license acquisition. In 2019 alone, **NFLX** is expected to spend more than $15 billion for content creation, up from $12 billion in 2018. This will be around 75% of its revenues. Add marketing, interest, technology... you won't be surprised that free cashflow is a whopping -$3.5 billion. Nice. General believe is that prices for production crews, sites and actors will increase due to higher competition - but most importantly only few of those produced content pieces will become hits. Will these suffice to keep the customer base happy? Or will they subscribe for a month, binge it, and unsubscribe again? **NFLX** library will be 80% rubbish (personal opinion here), while **DIS** with its vast archive of great movies just gets you to watch Star Wars for the 69th time. In order for **NFLX** to compete with a similarly big library, they will need to produce more and more and more, which means that they cannot uphold their notion to be able to finance content creation out of their own pockets. Which brings me elegantly to debt. 

More than $32 billion as of today. With 110 million subscribers globally, that is around $300 long-term debt per subscriber. Debt increased by nearly $7 billion from 2017 to 2018, and by another $7-8 billion from 2018 to 2019. Revenues grew by $4 billion and by $5 billion respectively. While revenues are recurring and debt is not, the question remains whether increasing interest payments will take a toll. Especially if the most profitable market stopped growing and investors see less upside in **NFLX**, interest rates for newly issued bonds will increase as well, exacerbating the cash flow situation. Interest expense in 2019 will easily exceed $600 million, that is more than 3% of revenues. 

So where does this leave **NFLX**? The domestic US market has stopped growing, but still requires new content to be created. Marketing spend is growing massively - only to **not lose** subscribers. Can **NFLX** increase prices? Not really. Churn rate already increased reportedly - and since users have competition to switch to, this will really hit them. 

**NFLX** debt increases and will continue to do so, since developing immature markets is expensive. Interest payments will have a higher impact. Competitors enter the market with more attractive pricing and a more attractive library. And deeper pockets. **AAPL**, **AMZN** and **DIS** have cash to spare - **NFLX** doesn't. The $150 billion market valuation is bound to collapse sooner rather than later. Especially since investors seem to move their money away from growth to value stocks.

So the question is not, whether **NFLX** will tank - but how much?",NFLX,dd netflix curtain close let deep look favourite junk bond financed content creator shall far important metric people look nflx

751,751,2019-12-07,"Has $NFLX reached peak market penetration in the US? The below table is adapted directly from the Netflix Q3 2019 earnings report. According to Netflix, their churn rate, i.e. people unsubscribing, is around 9% per quarter. Using this, one can calculate the total churn, the gross added subscriptions as well as the net added subscriptions. CAC (customer acquistion cost) is calulated by dividing marketing spend by gross added subscriptions, netCAC by dividing marketing spend by net added subscriptions. Numbers in thousands, apart from CAC and netCAC.

As you can see, CAC has only risen marginally. netCAC however - which is the important metric - has reached enormous levels. The marginal cost of adding one additional subscriber is nearly $410 - equal to more than 16 quarters of average revenue (\~$25). So right now it takes more than 16 quarters for a new user to just recoup the marketing spend.

The outlook: Netflix own estimates for total domestic subscriptions is 61.220.000 - that is adding 600.000 new subscribers in Q4. They also stated that marketing spend will be more weighted towards the fourth quarter. Let's just assume a lower bound of $312 million - which would be the same spend as in Q4 2018. In reality, marketing spend should be closer to $400 million, thanks to new competitors (Apple TV, Disney+, NBCUniversal's Peacock...). But numbers are already disastrous with the lower bound. $312 million for 600 thousand new subscriptions is around $520 per effective new subscriber. That is more than 20 quarters - or five years.

These numbers are unsustainable. Effectively, Netflix has reached its peak user baser in the US. There are around 129 million households in the US. Nearly 50% have a Netflix subscription (probably even more, if you consider shared accounts). There is just no one left who would still become a new Netflix subscriber.

At the same time, new competitors enter the ring (as mentioned above). Which means, that the churn rate might rise a little bit. Maybe up to 10%, maybe even 12%. More importantly though: the users who decide for a subscription service have a choice now. Disney+ is only $7 a month. And they've spent the last two years acquiring licenses for all time classic movies and series. This makes them a lot more attractive than Netflix.

Some people might even consider Apple TV - others have Amazon Prime Video. There is also Hulu, HBO Go and NBCUniversal's Peacock. What all of those companies have in common: They are not solely reliant on streaming as a source of revenue. Apple and Amazon have pockets deeper than the Mariana trench. Netflix doesn't. In fact, Netflix burns around $3.5 billion dollars of cash this year. And the year before. They have amassed more than $32 billion in debt. Financed through junk bonds. Just in 2019, their interest payments will be more than $600 million. Those numbers are rising dramatically. Unless they raise new capital...

Netflix uses the cash to produce new content. All kinds of movies and series. But here is the trap: In the moment they stop, people will unsubscribe. They do not have the same library depth anymore. I remember when I could watch ""The Godfather"" on Netflix (I am located in Germany). Not anymore. Same with other favourite movies of mine. So all Netflix has remaining, are their own productions. And so they have to produce and produce and produce more shows - while prices for production increase and they suddenly have to share the market with more players.

Internationalisation does not help much, since different cultures prefer different content. Series like ""Casa de papel"" which cater to an international audience are rare. So what should Netflix do? Continue their content-producing spending spree, getting more and more into debt? What if interest rates rise and suddenly they have to pay 8% or more?

Their latest issued bond is already at 6.375%:

[https://markets.businessinsider.com/bonds/netflix\_incdl-notes\_201919-29-bond-2029-us64110lax47](https://markets.businessinsider.com/bonds/netflix_incdl-notes_201919-29-bond-2029-us64110lax47)

So that means they have to stop spending so much on production and marketing. Unfortunately though, that would make people leave the platform even quicker. Also, they would lack arguments as to why people should subscribe in the first place.

Lastly, international growth will not help to ease the pressure. Each market wants their own series and movies. New markets are more expensive. And there will hardly be a market with similarly high revenue per subscription as the US.

While I am positive that Netflix will find its way - $150 billion market valuation is just 70% too much for a company that stopped growing in its most important market and burns $3.5 billion in cash every year. Financed by more and more expensive junk bonds and trapped in a ""damned if you do, damned if you do"" situation, there is really no basis whatsoever for a valuation as right now.

765,765,2019-12-31,"Apple Stock Will Repeat as Top FAANG in 2020, Says Bull Who Called 2019 
One year ago, Loup Ventures founder Gene Munster and his colleagues laid out a set of tech predictions for 2019. His top call: “Apple will be the best performing FAANG stock in 2019.” He nailed it, and sees five reasons Apple stock will continue rising.

One year ago, Loup Ventures founder Gene Munster and his colleagues laid out a set of tech predictions for 2019. His top call: “Apple will be the best performing FAANG stock in 2019.”

He nailed it: As we near year-end, Apple stock (ticker: AAPL) has rallied 86% year to date, well ahead of the other FAANGs: Facebook stock (FB) has rallied 59%; Amazon.com stock (AMZN), 24%; Netflix stock (NFLX), 23%; and Alphabet stock (GOOGL) (G as in Google), 30%.

While he’s lately been investing in startups, Munster built his reputation earlier in his career as an equity analyst covering Apple stock, generally bullishly, at Piper Jaffray.

Munster’s call on Apple’s big 2019 not only got the stock right—he also correctly called what drove the stock higher: A new focus on services, a better position than rivals on regulatory issues, and investor anticipation of 5G iPhones in 2020 and beyond.

Yep, Munster nailed it this year, and he’s going for it again.

Last week, Munster and Loup rolled out a set of predictions for 2020. And it starts with this one: “Apple is our pick for top performing FAANG stock in 2020.” He thinks fair value for Apple stock is in the $350 to $400 range, which implies a potential gain of more than 30%. On Monday, the stock is down about 1% at $286.79.
Munster offers five reasons he thinks the stock will keep rolling in 2020.

Easy iPhone comparisons: He thinks Apple is likely to meet or exceed analyst expectations in three of the four quarters of 2020 based on easy iPhone comparisons — he notes that iPhone sales were down year-over-year in all four quarters of fiscal 2019. He thinks iPhone will account for 20% of Apple’s revenue in fiscal 2020.

Wearables: Munster says Apple’s wearables sales will be larger than those for the Mac in 2020, driven by a new version of the AirPod with better battery life and continued growth for Apple Watch. There’s also the launch of a much-anticipated product called Apple Tags, which Munster says will attach to keys, wallets and other things to keep track of their locations. He sees wearables sales up 45% in 2020, driven primarily by AirPods and Apple Watch. “Beyond 2020, Apple Watch has significant room to grow, given that global Apple Watch adoption remains nascent,” he writes. “We expect 20%-30% Apple Watch unit growth for the next five years.” He thinks that by 2025, Apple Watch sales can reach $48 billion, or about 12% of Apple’s overall revenue.

New iPhone Models: Munster expects five new iPhone models in 2020, versus three new models in each of the last two years. All eyes are on the expected 5G launches in late 2020.

Investors Await 5G: Munster made this forecast a year ago, and updates it this time. “5G will be the biggest iPhone upgrade cycle since 2015, which benefited from the first full year of the larger-screen iPhone 6,” he writes. “Long term, we believe the 5G cycle can deliver two years of 10% iPhone revenue growth, compared to our expectation of iPhone revenue essentially flat in calendar 2020. That said, the iPhone 5G cycle will hit full stride in 2022 and 2023. We expect the product’s first full year (2021) to disappoint investors due to lack of 5G coverage from wireless carriers, which will act as a governor on iPhone 5G adoption.”

Multiple Expansion: “We expect AAPL’s earnings multiple to increase in 2020,” he writes. “Investors will begin to recognize Apple’s combination of hardware and services as a high-visibility and sticky business. The prevailing investor view is that shares of AAPL should be undervalued relative to peers based on a belief that the company’s risk profile is relatively higher, because 75% of its revenue comes from hardware. Over the past decade, Apple’s results have shown that the combination of hardware, software, and services can deliver earnings, the most important measure of financial strength, that exceed other tech companies with higher multiples. Over the next year, we believe investors will gain confidence in applying a more services-like multiple to AAPL given the hardware business (iPhone and wearables) will deliver revenue visibility similar to traditional services businesses.”

The performance award consists of a 10-year grant of stock options  that vests in 12 tranches. Each of the 12 tranches vests only if a pair  of milestones are both met.

* Market Cap Milestones: To meet the first market cap milestone, Tesla's current market cap must increase to $100 billion. For each of the remaining 11 milestones, Tesla's market cap must continue to increase in additional $50 billion increments. Thus, for Elon to fully vest in the award, Tesla's market cap must increase to $650 billion.
* Operational Milestones: To meet the operational milestones, Tesla  must meet a set of escalating Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA targets (the  only adjustment to EBITDA is for stock-based compensation). These  milestones are even more directly aligned with shareholder value  creation than those used in Elon's 2012 performance award. They are  designed to ensure that as Tesla's market cap grows, the company is also  executing well on both a top-line and bottom-line basis.

For each of the 12 tranches that is achieved, Elon will vest in  stock options that correspond to 1% of Tesla's current total outstanding  shares (1% of that amount is approximately 1.69 million shares). If  none of the 12 tranches is achieved, Elon will not receive any  compensation.

777,777,2020-01-13,"Why Tesla has become a must-own stock With clear competitive advantages in powertrain design, battery, ADAS fleet size, and a brand that consumers get excited about, TSLA should be a must-own stock for the next several years. As the renewables and autonomy trends accelerate, Tesla should not only gain shares, but also realize significant operating leverage. It has reached sufficient scale to achieve sustainable FCF, although the company's higher risk tolerance may also mean the stock will continue to trade with higher volatility. A few additional data points on why Tesla has become a must-own for the next few years.

1) Analysts believe Tesla is tracking about 3 years ahead of competition in their powertrain technology.

2) With 600k+ vehicles on the road collecting data, Tesla has a significant advantage in evolving their Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS).

3) Tesla's above-average risk tolerance has also resulted in accelerated learning cycles, as reflected in their fast ramp up in China.

4) With Model 3/Y platform development complete, capacity expansion across China and Germany should drive operating leverage and upside to margin over next 36 months (but China may be a drag on near term margins).

781,781,2020-01-16,"My revised (again) model of TSLA through 2028 (Price Target of $17,600 in 2028) Hi gang,

I posed two different models in the last 6 years that I'm continually revisiting and updating based on new data that's available to me.

Here's the first one below from 6 years ago where I attached a $450 price target by end of 2018
https://old.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1k15cb/my_model_of_tsla_through_2013/?st=k5h2987i&sh=78a9694b

Here's the second one I posted a year later with a price target of $800 by end of 2020
https://old.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1yn1kx/my_revised_model_of_tesla_tsla_by_2023/?st=k5h26rti&sh=43f78d64

It appears that my models are running roughly a year behind of where my assumptions are ending up, so I figured I'd share my latest model for your viewing and entertainment pleasure.

In no way am I trying to insinuate that my models are somehow predicting where Tesla's price is going to end up - I'm simply sharing my thought process with you fine folks in the investing community to gather feedback and understand different points of view.

See below model:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GUPfQhpFfax8lYC4iyvYT-gD_i9LIRkngFB_o6MZXA8/edit?usp=sharing

My broad assumptions:

* There will be a 90,000,000 global new vehicle market in 2028
* Roughly 50% of those sales will be electric
* Tesla will capture 17% of the EV market which is roughly 7.6 million cars a year
* I'm assuming a new vehicle introduced in 2025 that will capture the truly affordable car market that will be designed in China and released for worldwide consumption (average of $20k per car without autonomous features). This is called Cybercar in the model
* Autonomous vehicle revenue will begin to kick in around the year 2025
* By 2028, roughly 33% of Tesla's new fleet sales (7.6 * .33 = 2.3m) will be generating some level of revenue for the company as autonomous revenue. For this model I'm assuming $7.3k of sales from autonomous per unit on average at 80% margin
* I'm assuming roughly 1% dilution YoY
* I'm assuming ~300k Tesla operated RoboTaxis manufactured yearly by Tesla to cover gaps in coverage in the self driving network
* I'm assuming Tesla Energy to grow to generate similar levels of sales from the Energy business by 2028 as compared to Auto
* i'm assuming a total operating income % of sales of 17.3% on $508b of revenue by 2028
* I'm assuming a 38 P/E multiple on $87b of yearly earnings by 2028

That covers all the big picture stuff as it pertains to what the model takes into account.

The price is obviously eye popping and would give Tesla a market cap of ~3.5 trillion. However, the way I think about this company is drawing a parallel to Apple, which is a Hardware company that has a SaaS (Software as a Service) component bolted on top of it selling units that generate vastly more $ per unit sold, and is entering an entirely disrupted market in the last 100 years that is about as large as it gets on the auto side - and then you add energy on top of it.

Let me know your thoughts.

For the time being, $BABA and $MSFT have culturally different clientele, providing a favorable moat to $MSFT in the US and with allies (UK, EU, AU, NZ) and the Western hemisphere neighborhood (LATAM). Of course, that's before we get to PaaS, which $MSFT serves as a leader in some of the most cutting edge (AI/ML, IoT), and as the uncontested king of on premise and hybrid cloud in enterprises.

&#x200B;

* **THE MILITARY-INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX HATH SPOKEN:** Unless you're living under a rock, you've probably heard about JEDI and DEOS. The monopoly that $AMZN once enjoyed in the cleared space  is now in the crosshairs of \*\[the new\] big blue. This opens the door for Microsoft to gain all types of opportunities in the highly profitable federal space, and some of which it is uniquely positioned for with it's Azure Stack Hub and array of edge devices. Microsoft, with it's already deeply established sales and relationships with the DoD, will have no problems capitalizing on this opportunity. It's only just beginning. Microsoft can leverage a huge partner base, and don't forget that US defense companies can increase that leverage too.
   * Azure Stack Hub is a hybrid cloud platform by Microsoft that can be run fully disconnected and power containers (Kubernetes, Docker), other PaaS platforms (Pivotal CF, Red Hat OpenShift), and more. The solution has a multi-year head start in the availability in the marketplace, ahead of AWS competing solution Outpost - of which does not support fully disconnected scenarios.
* **O365, DYNAMICS, LINKEDIN, AND GITHUB ARE EASY MONEY:** $MSFT is enjoying the fruits of its acquisition(al) labors on one hand, and the easiest inflows of cash via O365, which will see increased growth as more cleared / defense onboard into O365 and dog-whistle Teams.
* **ENJOYS THE TAILWINDS OF A RECORD YEAR**: $MSFT and Azure are coming along from record highs, with yearly gains between the 50-60% respectively. If you're bullish on the S&P 500/DOW, you can be bullish on Microsoft - and expect it to outperform. Microsoft has enjoyed steady climbs after most favorable earning events, provided its largely institutional (\~73%) ownership isn't panicking.
* **ADD per** u/ryryshouse6 **THE GREEN BUTTERFLY AFFECT:** As ETFs, funds, and retail investors will continue to gravitate toward environmentally-friendly companies, $MSFT serves as a very attractive Software Service option for managers to justify taking or increasing stakes with $MSFT.

I punched out the numbers and found that Netflex subscriber growth hasn't moved much at all with the integration of competitive platforms via ESPN+, Disney, Apple TV, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, etc. This makes a lot of sense because much of the aforementioned platforms are only going to last several month to a year and expire without resubsciption. This is mainly speculative, but many of these services are actually paired with purchases of new cellphone plans and product purchases (i.e. Free Disney with Apple iPhone 11 purchase, Free Amazon Prime Video for Amazon Prime (making the video segment a non-factor), Hulu with it's year long $1.99 p/m subscription deal offered last Christmas, and ESPN+ which is mainly tailored for sports and no longer offers any viable content since pay-per view is always going to be an added cost). 

On the topic of cashflow, which is huge for Netflix and a primary driver of it's devaluation. In Q1 ER, they burned through $1.7B, and the expected for the rest of the year is going to be around $2.5. They said 2019 was the biggest cash burn year to get the platform on track by increase content value, ease of access, marketing, etc. Seems to me Netflix is making the adjustments to go cash flow positive.

However, Intel's and IBM's earnings report gave us a glimpse into the future to confirm how well Microsoft will perform. 

We know that Microsoft is developing several new data centers, as their cloud computing platform continues to grow faster than AWS. Intel confirms these growths are larger than expected. 

> Revenue from the company’s Data Center Group, which makes chips for computer servers, was up about 19% at $7.21 billion, more than the $6.40 billion FactSet analyst consensus.

IBM also confirmed a large growth in cloud computing.

> IBM CFO: Q4 results driven by acceleration of hybrid cloud portfolio.

This was the best single day gain IBM has seen in a decade.

There is a huge surge in new Windows purchases as well.

> In the first half of the year Intel will be able to sell chips as people upgrade to Microsoft’s Windows 10 operating system — Microsoft’s support for Windows 7 ended earlier this month — and that factor will taper off in the second half, Swan said.

In addition to this, Microsoft Teams is growing faster than Slack, and their Office 365 special edition ran out of stock (limited subscription).

The Dow Jones Industrial Average increased more than 22% in 2019 and  is already up 2.2% through three weeks of 2020, but it is about to face  its biggest test of the young year, and potentially many years.

Nearly half of the 30 Dow  [DJIA, -0.58%](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/djia?mod=MW_story_quote) components are scheduled to  report results from the holiday season in the coming week, which will be  by far the busiest week of the earnings season.

There are 14  Dow companies expected to report, the most companies from the blue-chip  index to report in a single week since at least 2014, a group that  includes two trillion-dollar market caps in Apple Inc. [AAPL, -0.29%](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/aapl?mod=MW_story_quote) and Microsoft Corp [MSFT, -1.01%](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/msft?mod=MW_story_quote) Plenty of non-Dow  companies will throw their numbers in as well — 141 of the S&P 500  companies are expected to report, including Facebook Inc. [FB, -0.83%](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/fb?mod=MW_story_quote), Amazon.com Inc.

The 85 members of the S&P 500 that have reported results thus far  have seen net income fall by 0.3% on average from a year ago, though  Credit Suisse Chief U.S. Equity Strategist Jonathan Golub said it’s  tough to make broader inferences from early reports given different  sectors tend to post results at different parts of the earnings cycle.  More than a third of S&P 500 that have reported so far sit in the  financials sector, which could skew those results.

The  FactSet consensus currently calls for net income to fall by 1.9% for  the S&P 500, based on a blend of reported results and analyst  projections, which would mean [the current earnings recession ](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/earnings-recession-is-expected-to-swallow-all-of-2019-after-holiday-forecasts-disappoint-2019-11-22)would swallow all of 2019’s results.

795,795,2020-01-27,"Under what conditions can Apple's capitalization get the $ 2 trillion? Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, raised his target price for Apple shares to $ 400. The long-term growth in iPhone sales and the continued expansion of Apple’s service business could push the technology giant’s capitalization to $ 2 trillion in capitalization by the end of 2021, the expert said.

https://preview.redd.it/z31drbszjbd41.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d6c401ac198b437bcd63e055598266a2885bd10

The cost of the tech giant has already risen by almost 10% year on year after rising 86% in 2019, but Ives sees that the company's shares will grow in the next few years due to the advent of the iPhone with 5G support and growing service business. In a recent note, the analyst set a new target price for Apple shares, raising it from $ 350 to $ 400 per share.

""Despite the fact that stocks are experiencing growth over the past year and in 2020, we continue to believe that it is imperative to keep Apple stocks in our investment portfolio, over the next 12-18 months we are waiting for the start of the transformative 5G supercycle,"" wrote Ives.

Apple expects to release all 5G models of iPhone smartphones by the end of 2020. Deliveries of devices with support for the range below 6 GHz (Sub-6 GHz) and the millimeter range (mmWave) should begin at the end of III or the beginning of IV quarters. According to analyst Min-Chi Kuo, the development of 5G iPhone models is going according to plan. New items should be presented at the traditional September presentation of Apple.

Apple shares are expected to rise amid the announcement of fourth-quarter results next week. The steady sales of the iPhone 11 and the explosive popularity of AirPods should help Apple surpass quarterly grades and potentially raise its March forecast.

Apple is currently valued at $ 1,4 trillion from Microsoft, Alphabet and Saudi Aramco, which also valued at more than $ 1 trillion. Aramco was the first company to hit $ 2 trillion in capitalization in December after a record-high IPO, but since then its share price has fallen below historical levels.

Tesla TSLA+2.49%  said it earned $105 million, or 56 cents a share, in the fourth quarter, compared with $140 million, or 78 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted for one-time items, the company earned $2.14 a share, compared with $2 a share a year ago.


Revenue rose 2% to $7.4 billion, compared with $7.2 billion a year ago.

Analysts polled by FactSet had expected the car maker to report adjusted earnings of $1.77 a share on sales of $7 billion.

The after-hours share surge continued as Tesla hosted its conference call with investors, and a mention of potential delays in the Model 3 production in Shanghai due to the deadly coronavirus did nothing to temper investors’ enthusiasm.

**tl;dr; the post is NOT about advocating selling of MSFT (I have no view on the stock), the title is a clickbait.**

\---

&#x200B;

[This article from BBG](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-04/the-only-thing-outpacing-tesla-are-its-10-000-option-winnings?sref=C5KKabzI) sparked a kind of retard frenzy. Particularly this part:

>There’s an element of circularity at play, but this activity may be contributing to the rally in the shares. **When a trader buys a call, the dealer who sells it will typically buy a certain amount of stock in the underlying to offset their exposure. If the shares continue to rise, dynamically managing that hedge can entail increasing purchases.**  
>  
>“So, now you get the picture, that every day **at the open lately, folks are grabbing call options quickly and driving the stocks/indexes higher,”** writes Scott Murray of Volatility Analytics. “It is much easier for this kind of market to be unhinged, as long call holders’ corresponding dealer position is long the underlying.”

So /r/wsb thinks it discovered the holy grail, because it learned that sellers of options hedge their delta.

u/SuXs, managed to distinguish himself from the imbecile masses of the subreddit, by appearing to truly believe that if he manages to convince some people to buy $200 MSFT calls, the dealers will buy enough shares to offset their delta to make a $1tn stock rally.

Just check out his recent submission history - reads like a strong CV for a position of a full retard: [https://i.imgur.com/x3T544x.png](https://i.imgur.com/x3T544x.png)

I left the Bear Gang post there on purpose as a cherry on top of this pile of pure idiocy.

News flash - delta hedging becomes a factor when a stock goes up 20% in a day. Or 100% in a month.  Not when you place a $100k (let's be generous) order for $200 MSFT calls. Also, while TSLA can conceivably go to $1000 or $1200 or $700 over the next week, those kinds of moves are not in cards for MSFT - hence even less need to aggressively delta hedge.

MSFT is a solid company. But today, I sincerely hope it totally shits the bed or else you dumb motherfuckers will really believe that by having 20 guys spend $300 each on an OTM call you can make the share price of a $1tn company go up.

BTW buying OTM calls at the open has nothing to do with HFT spoofing of orders that Navinder Sarao got busted for. That guy was just flashing a huge order on the bid side to move the market marginally up (and opposite for ask side). He never intended for those orders to be filled, so he was quickly cancelling them after getting the desired effect.

In these artistic work of fictions, I pretended that my goal was to see if it is possible for a collective of autists such as r/WSB to use the integrated leverage of:

- Call contracts 100:1 ratios
- Institutions algorithms risk hedging strategies.
- Social Media
- W E A P O N I S E D.  A U T I S M.

And combine it into a Low Orbit Ion Cannon (LOIC) conflagration with enough power to actually inflate a $1.5Trillion Market Cap stock ($MSFT), at open, on 05.02.2020.

[**On Tuesday**](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/jeff-bezos-just-sold-18-billion-in-amazon-stock-2020-02-04), filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission disclosed that the Amazon founder and CEO had sold 905,456 shares on Friday and Monday for a total of $1.84 billion. According to new [**SEC**](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000089924320003505/xslF345X03/doc4.xml)[**filings**](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000089924320003503/xslF345X03/doc4.xml) Thursday, Bezos sold an additional 810,912 shares Tuesday and Wednesday for around $1.65 billion. That brings his nearly weeklong total to more than 1.7 million shares sold for about $3.49 billion.

The four-day selloff equates to about 3% of his total Amazon [**AMZN,** **+0.51%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/amzn?mod=MW_story_quote)   stake.

The sales were pre-arranged, though they coincided with Amazon becoming just the fourth U.S. company [**to reach $1 trillion in market cap** ](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/amazon-is-officially-worth-1-trillion-joining-other-tech-titans-2020-02-04)earlier this week.

Bezos typically sells off large chunks of his Amazon shares throughout the year, at pre-arranged times. [**Last August**](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/jeff-bezos-has-sold-almost-3-billion-in-amazon-stock-over-the-past-week-2019-08-05), he sold nearly 1.5 million shares for about $2.84 billion, during a time when Amazon stock was suffering its worst losing streak in 13 years.

Bezos is the world’s richest individual, by a comfortable margin. His $126 billion fortune is about $9 billion more than the runner-up, Microsoft Corp.

To keep this post a reasonable length I will link to my valuation hosted on Adobe's document cloud. [Link to full valuation in pdf format here!](https://documentcloud.adobe.com/link/track?uri=urn%3Aaaid%3Ascds%3AUS%3Ae4edb1a1-16a2-4e6a-a52b-b4a105a981c7) (If you want to skip the explanation of the inputs the story behind the numbers is located on pages 8-9 and the DCF model is located on page 10). Please take a look at the valuation before bashing or agreeing with my range.

For the past year Apple has been on a massive run with seemingly no sign of stopping. Analysts have been upping their price targets and managers who have missed out on the run are piling in. With Apple recently reporting earnings, there has been renewed debate about what price investors should be paying for stock in Apple. Many say that the company is expensive and point to relative valuation measures such as P/E that are above their long term averages. Others say the company is inexpensive and point to growing revenue segments such as wearables and services.

My preferred method of valuing companies is intrinsic valuation, and what I present here is an intrinsic valuation assessing the value of equity in Apple using a DCF model. I am hoping to start a discussion about what others believe that Apple stock is worth, as well as what assumptions I have made that others agree or disagree with.

I present a base case, bull case, and bear case for Apple and what each of those scenarios would potentially look like. If I was an analyst I would give the stock a buy rating and place the fair value range of Apple stock between $350 and $400. This is NOT a price target and is based on the assumptions which are outlined in the paper.

   * \* that 70 Million has gone up throughout the years.  As of 2018 its up to 85 Mil.
* FTC announced today that they will be investigating FAAAM in regards to HSR going back to 2010.
* The investigation will focus on ""deals of companies that could have potentially developed into larger businesses, and moves by tech giants that increased their influence in adjacent markets.""
* In plane English:  The FTC is worried that during the last decade, FAAAM used HSR to squash competition before it could arise and take over the world.  A easy example of expansion: Amazon buying a bunch of small manufacturing companies so they suddenly have the infrastructure to produce Amazon Basics, products designed to compete with everyday needs.  An example of competition: Facebook buying a small social media company worth 50 Mil that could have easily grown into an Instagram competitor.
* The FAAAM are tanking today because everyone savy enough to have watched and understood the Social Network already knows this is true and this investigation will turn over some dirty laundry.

This experience will rely on 5G. The Xbox Series X may play a big role in this because of the following:

>Edge computing will be a key enabler for 5G to deliver on its bandwidth and latency requirements

What if the weird shape of the Xbox Series X is due to built-in 5G antennas?

To back this speculation up, Microsoft says it’s planning ‘bold’ moves to make you pick the Xbox Series X over Sony’s PS5: [https://bgr.com/2020/02/11/xbox-series-x-vs-ps5-microsoft-has-bold-launch-plans-for-new-xbox/](https://bgr.com/2020/02/11/xbox-series-x-vs-ps5-microsoft-has-bold-launch-plans-for-new-xbox/)

Part of this bold move will assuredly be coupling the Xbox Series X with the xCloud, which is Microsofts cloud-based gaming service and it runs off of Microsoft’s Azure data centers. [https://www.geekwire.com/2019/testing-microsofts-project-xcloud-new-streaming-service-feels-like-magic-trick/](https://www.geekwire.com/2019/testing-microsofts-project-xcloud-new-streaming-service-feels-like-magic-trick/)

**Azure and 5G**

Microsoft has been hard at work setting themselves up for this. Remember the JEDI contract?

Well what if JEDI is only the tip of the iceberg? Who cares about one $10B contract with the Department of Defense when 5G-serving wireless carriers are paying you for organizing 5G data distribution?

>Microsoft, Dell, and others are not developing 5G infrastructure hardware. Instead, they are developing a common engineering standard that would allow 5G software developers to run code atop machines that come from nearly any 5G hardware manufacturer.

If all goes accordingly, headlines will read AWS defeated by Azure. Refocusing attention on Microsoft's profitable and growing cloud business. Not to mention, this is a 10 year deal with openings to new government cloud deals.

***Why is this a big deal?***

From my personal experience in the cloud business, I've worked directly with one of Amazon's subsidiaries on large cloud deals (over 7-figures) in Asia & South America for streaming services that needed low-latency that AWS could not provide due to their datacenter locations. It took our company over 7 months through litigation, red-lines, etc to finalize a contract. One the contract was finished and approved, getting new business can be done in the same day, i.e., once Microsoft is awarded, they can continue growing their government deals as needed, in the same day.

Thus, tomorrow's ruling is a big win (if it happens) for Microsoft.

Update: [the author just posted a new article](https://federalnewsnetwork.com/defense-main/2020/02/as-key-jedi-court-decision-looms-pentagon-warns-of-national-security-concerns/)

A few key takeaways:

1. ""...the government argued not only that Amazon lacks the necessarily legal basis to get the temporary stop-work order, issuing one would cause **concrete harm to national security**.""

*Favors MSFT*

2) ""...To win the injunction, among other factors, Amazon needs to show that it’s likely to win the underlying lawsuit and that it its interests would suffer more without a work stoppage than the government’s would if the JEDI buildout was paused.""

*Favors MSFT*

3) “While still lacking several key features of the JEDI Cloud…\[DoD\] anticipates a  financial  harm of between $5 and $7 million dollars every month that performance of the JEDI contract is delayed.”

*Nail in the coffin. Case dismissed. MSFT, flawless victory.*

1) **27% of US households surveyed said they will consider substituting one SVOD for another**, which implies \~16m NFLX subs are at risk of cancelling to join a new entrant.

2) **62% of US households pay for 2+ SVOD services, but only 10% take 4+**, which means homes are more likely to substitute an existing service than adding a new service.

3) **84% of households surveyed said cost is the most important factor in their decision**, so NFLX is likely to lose subs being priced at $9-16/month or 30-100% higher than Disney+, Apple TV+, CBS All Access, Peacock.

4) **AVOD continues to take share from SVOD**.

5) With **unique program titles up 10% y/y to 646k at the end of 2019**, quality content seems to be ubiquitous and increasingly commoditized. This indicates that customer acquisition cost is rising, and differentiation is increasingly driven by marketing spend rather than content.

* Windows OEM revenue up 18%.

I expect Heather Bellini, analyst at Goldman Sachs, to raise PT for Microsoft very soon. Here's [her take on FastMoney yesterday](https://youtu.be/YxhlZ0EQANU?t=72) stating she's not only bullish short-term, but long-term as well.

Last, but not least, (sighs) the JEDI contract is **still awarded** to Microsoft (fuck you Jeff).

Next steps:

1) *""Amazon must submit a plan for offering the money to the court by next Thursday, and it must agree to redactions to the judge’s order no later than Feb. 27 so that it can be made public.""*

2) *""On Thursday, Judge Campbell-Smith also required that Amazon pay a $42 million deposit that the court will hold in case it later determines that the injunction was wrongfully issued and that Microsoft is owed damages""*

Well, now that my autism has peaked, and I've rolled a significant amount of gains over, (MOST into cash, but some into TSLA lottos, but a LOT into MSFT), I'm either setting up for a GIANT payday on MacroHARD (3-4x payday) when this JEDI crap settles (or a massive loss porn).

I've been playing MSFT options since the 160s last month and have been rolling forward ever since... Currently holding 100 shares as a down payment on 2021 taxes (\~18,500 value), and as of today 126 near term contracts for MICROSOFT, equaling about $18,800.

Almost every day this week i've added to my MSFT position as clearly there is no reason for MSFT to go down except Jeff Bozos complaining about Trump.

TLDR: I took most of my tendies from TSLA and rolled them into MSFT

869,869,2020-02-17,"Some basic tools for your toolkit so you stop losing money on expired options Since it's a holiday and we're all bored anyway I'm going to give you some *very* basic things to think about before you open a position. Who am I? I'm just a random dude with some business and finance education. I have had limited success and failures (over the past two years I've been up 90% and down 60%), but the key is that I *haven't cashed out of the game yet*. So, if you're looking for ways to justify your gambling addiction, read on. If you want to be the one retard who learns something today and not the 9 retards posting stupid shit in the comments, read on.

Today I've picked a nice mix of glaring WSB faults and interesting things:

1. Risk and reward expectations
2. Stock and Options packages (ETFs and multilegs)
3. Research aka Due diligence (DD)

Let's dive in friendos!

**Risk and reward expectations** \- Generally investment managers, financiers, and traders gauge their performance for a quarter or year based on how they did **relative to the market**. So if the S&P 500 only grows 6% in a year, a trader is successful if they made 9% gain that year. If the S%P 500 grows 20% like in 2019, you could literally just park your money in stocks and sell a year later for 20% gain, no skill involved. **Historically, the market has grown 10%** ***a year.*** I mention this in bold because most newcomers here really need to have their risk/reward expectations reframed. Usually the rewards are directly related to the risk that you lose everything. Doubling your money with a yolo call position is *incredibly risky and you are likely to lose all of your money*. This isn't a bear/bull thing (which is fucking stupid anyway. Imagine gambling/investing based on a fucking animal mascot). Pouring your money into shares of an S&P 500 index is much more safe and likely to preserve your money. I think there is a big contingent of big brained smarties on this board who want much more risk and reward than buying shares, but don't want to fuck in the dark on WSB meme options. If you are ok making 5-10% a week instead of 5-10% a year, read on.

**Stock and options packages** \- Stocks get packaged up by companies and resold to you in two ways: mutual funds and Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). These are pretty much the same thing - a bundle of stocks that you buy into - except ETFs are... exchange-traded aka sold as shares. Why do companies do this? To hedge against the risk we talked about before!

We need to digress for a second into different kinds of risk. If you had 0 toleration for risk, if you wanted a virtual guarantee of not losing money, how can you invest? You can buy **US Treasury bonds.** The rate of return on US treasury bonds is literally called *the risk-free rate* in finance and is about 1.6%/year or something right now. Pitiful. In our desire to see bigger returns *we must take on bigger risks.* There is **firm specific risk** related to the operations and financing of a specific firm ($BABA, $MSFT, $ADI). Let's say we didn't want to deal with this risk. We just want to take advantage of their growth of an industry, sector, or the market as a whole, without getting burned by the mistakes of any one individual firm. Then we can *diversify away* *firm-specific risk* and deal only with **market risk** by purchasing shares of every company in an industry, sector, or market. So State Street Global Advisors purchases a weighted average of the S&P 500 and sells that package to you as $SPY. Any one success or failure in the S&P 500 doesn't make SPY move much; it moves the way the market moves in general.

Ok, so, there are indexes/ETFs for everything. Whole market, biotech, manufacturing, industrial power, you name it. These are incredibly successful products - $SPY, $TQQQ, $PEY - because they are less risky and move slower than the individual stocks in the funds. What's the deal with options packages? **Options packages hedge risk in exchange for lower returns and are available on Robinhood (but never take the pre-built offered packages)**. Take a second at this point to go to investopedia and get a handle on spreads - you'll see things like Bull/Bear Put/Call credit/debit spread.

With these risk hedges, **Options spreads on index ETFs are the right risk and return for me**.

Lets do an example with a single stock share:

So let's say you have a belief that $MSFT is going up, but you don't want to *risk* everything on straight calls that could expire worthless in a week. You have some *options* (pun intended). You can reduce your risk by changing the rules - open a *bull put (credit) spread* so that you don't need $MSFT to go up, you just need it to not go down. Or you can lower the cost of your calls (and the reward) by opening a *bull call (debit) spread.* What I love about these is that the only cost/collateral RH requires is that difference between strikes in a spread. For instance, I have a SPY bull put spread right now with strikes at 330 and 329 - RH required $100 in collateral and gave me 12 dollars credit when I opened it (the difference between selling to open the 330 put and buying to open the 329 put), and I think I can close it out this week for a cost of 5 dollars, netting me 7$ on my 100. That doesn't sound flashy except that *7% a week is literally rich people insaneo gains on a relatively safe bet.* If you've read this far, my secret volatility play this week is opening a condor tomorrow on $ADI and closing it after earnings. EPS is estimated to be pretty low, but the firm's operating cycle is absolutely solid, so I think it'll move sideways on the news and we're going to make money on the IV crush. $1 spreads on the low and high ends, with strikes roughly 6% out of the money. Open it for 30 bucks credit tomorrow, close it for 15 bucks debit on Thursday.

**Due Diligence** \- DD is more art than science, and it's going to look different for stocks than for options, but in either case often the only difference between sweating nervously for a week while you look for a way to not lose so much, and relaxing confidently in your purchase, is 15 minutes of research. **The price of a share is related to the performance of the firm, even in 2020.** If you're trying to do DD on a specific firm as an amatuer, you want to look at 3 things - Quarterly/annual reports of earnings, analyst opinions, and the sector as a whole. Let's take $MSFT for example: Big revenue growth each year for the past decade, analysts say that Azure and Teams are solid products, and the tech sector is growing, so there's room for $MSFT to go up without having to take market share from competitors. That info took me 5 minutes to find, and with it I'm very confident that purchasing shares of $MSFT is a good idea. You can usually go to a company's website to find their financial information in a government tax filing form called a 10-k, but that can be pretty dense. You're looking for a page called the Balance Sheet.

880,880,2020-02-24,"Value Investing Tesla (TSLA) Trying to separate the hype from reality here to come up with a **conservative** valuation for Tesla. Upshot is $630 per share reflects a decent entry point. This is why:

1. Conservatively, discount the value of solar and battery sales. These are growth businesses but market size is not necessarily huge/exists at the whim of subsidies. Only consider the vehicle business, which is where the more certain growth is.
2. Treat it as if it's an ordinary car company. This conservative strategy requires dismissing the hype about potential tangential business lines like autonomous software licensing, which is one of Ark's big bull points.
3. Value it as if it will mature selling about 6 million cars per year. This is based on the fact that it has shown a growing ability to displace low-priced IC vehicles like the Corolla and Accord, and over time can take a hefty chunk of that market share. Sales could exceed 6 million if only supply were there, but right now the pace of production capacity growth will limit the company to 6 million vehicles per year by about 2030. Any production growth faster than that is optimistic and  assumes an ability to pick up the pace of factory openings faster than it has historically been able to. Fremont was a preexisting factory, Shanghai took a year and a half, Berlin will take at least a year, semi/cyber site has not been announced yet. Basically, Tesla has shown it can break ground on about 1 factory per year but hasn't proven it can do so faster than that.
4. Median car company enterprise value per vehicle sold is about $27,300. Assuming similar value, 6 million vehicle sales per year puts enterprise value about $163.8 billion, which accounting for debt and cash places the equity price not far from current levels in $800-$900 range.
5. Requiring a solid 30% cushion against this valuation strategy places a decent entry target at $630.

Note that this does NOT mean it's a short here at $830ish. It means this is near fair value, but you should require a return and not invest AT fair value, hence only buying at a more attractive $6 handle.

So while everything is tanking, the real question is which stock has the largest potential to drop.

Most every stock has dropped to it's 12/31/19 price except for netflix. Right now they are at $375 while there 12/31 was in the $320s. This has the largest potential to drop.

*Regarding the bull argument that everyone will be watching Netflix during quarantine.* I agree people will be watching a ton, but I doubt subs will increase. 100 million subs watching zero hours of netflix pays the same as all of them watching 24/7. A cash run doesn't discriminate between stocks. Plus, Gilmore girls isn't loud enough to drown out my wife with her BF.

Since this is not an ad-driven model, there is no revenue upside to the increase in viewing hours unless it translates to more subscribers.

Internationally, NFLX is considered a luxury service at a time when the overall economy is beginning to reflect the impact of travel restrictions and employment is increasingly at risk (particularly across the service industry). Tourism is 10% of GDP in France, 13% in Italy, and 15% in Spain. This means NFLX subscriber losses in these markets may rise.

I realize that this journal entry got a bit lengthy, so I chopped it into three parts, plus a very hand-wavy speculative conclusion part.

----     
The Pump  
-----     

Mid-January 2020, articles begin pumping TSLA as Musk announces share purchases.    
    
_Markets Insider -  Tesla short sellers have lost nearly $12 billion in just 7 weeks_     
     
_Markets Insider - Tesla has yet another biggest bull on Wall Street. Here's why he thinks the stock could surge 57%._    
     
_Electrek - Tesla (TSLA) gets new $800 price target based on its ability to execute_        
     
Musk is no stranger to stock pumping. Last year he advertised a private share price of 420$, ""funding secured"", to draw in investors. It is not surprising that this time the company (or another party) has turned to media outlets to get article placement from a third party. It is frowned-upon, but not uncommon, for companies to pay journalists, through brokers, to place articles in major publications.   

At the same time, mid-January, coordinated social media and message board posts appeared hyping TSLA and urging users to buy stock. Social media posts appeared on reddit, twitter, facebook about the price of Tesla on trajectory for $1000/share. Many influential users were caught in the frenzy and spread the word. A reddit and twitter user named /u/WSBgod began buying calls in TSLA at $600+; posting his positions and urging his large follower base to do the same. Many of these social media posts were well-written, edgy and bear the hallmarks of professional  copywriters.    

----    
The Dump    
----   
Tesla price began to rise. Viral social media posts and positive articles created high demand for TSLA stock, driving retail investors into a frenzy. On some message boards, users were seen urging people to take credit card advances or student loans to buy Tesla stock at $600+.   

At this point, a short-term ""spike"" in Teslas price occured. For the purposes of discussion, we will consider $767 (the stock issue price, discussed below) at market close to be the defining price of the spike.   

This spike began on 02/03 and ended on 02/26. The stock market was open 18 days  during this window. More remarkably, the closing price of TSLA was only above $767 per share on *12 days* during the window.   
**Chart of the 767$ price line and the recent spike**:   
https://gfycat.com/quaintslimyeuropeanpolecat   

It turns out this short stock market spike was no surprise to Tesla. Tesla and Goldman Sachs were already preparing to issue stock during this narrow period. Tesla filed an 8-K on 02/19 to issue  2.65 million new shares at $767 per share. Teslas/Goldman's  ""luck"" allowed them to issue on one of the top ten highest dates in TSLA history.    

Social media and message board influencers sold dreams of $1500 ""moon"" prices to middle-class retail investors. Many of his new investors were young; drawn by the new mobile-based, zero-commision brokers such as Robinhood. These younger investors typically turn to social media for their stock research. 

Many new and inexperienced investors are unfamiliar with stock ""dilution"" (the concept that issuing new stock devalues existing shareholders). Some shareholders even took to message boards to praise Tesla/Goldman for issuing more shares. Tesla raked in $2.31 billion of that cash advance, student loan, and summer job money during this short period of time, by issuing new shares at the $767 price.    

While the stock issue was happening, insiders began exercising options and dumping their stock. There is nothing intrinsically wrong with insiders selling stock. However  they were *very lucky* that this period happened mid-February - directly in-between earnings calls. This is one of the few timeframes outside of their blackout dates (blackout dates tend to cover most dates in the year for executives, particularly around earnings).

Five insiders can be seen exercising (buying) options and dumping stock during the narrow 18-day February spike time frame. Amidst the insider sales there is only one insider purchase - a well-publicized stock purchase by Elon Musk himself.     

https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/TSLA/insider-trades/    

----     
The wreckage settles     
----     

After the dump finished, the retail investor money was safely in the hands of insiders and Teslas cash reserves. Nameless large traders (known as ""whales"") began dumping the shares in high-volume batches, reaping the final harvest of the inflated stock price. Coincidentally, Covid-19 caused a general decrease in stock prices on the NYSE. The stock price plummeted. TSLA is now hovering around ~$400/share on 03/18, less than half the price of the all-time high where retail investors were paying upwards of $800-900 per share.    

Tesla is now $2.31 billion richer (although Tesla's high cash burn rate will incinerate this money within two quarters). Insiders at Tesla have gained hundreds of millions from their timely exit.    

On twitter and message boards, many users are depressed and downtrodden. The investment they purchased during the flurry of hype has lost its value. Many of the users who bought TSLA now joke about suicide or selling their house. Many users who got caught in the Tesla hype are silent - ashamed of their losses. Many are selling their devalued shares at a huge loss and will not return to invest in stocks for the time being.      

-----   
The other kind of speculation   
----    
Stock frenzys are not a new phenomenon. We can blame the media for the unrealistic moonshot expectations towards TSLA during the hype period.     
    
Yet, it is tough not to look at the timing of the entire event and squint:    
* The company orchestrated one of its largest stock issues during a very narrow 12 day market peak window -  a masterstroke in perfect timing and preparation     
* The media blitz ""pump"" occurred despite Teslas high debt load and extremely low car production rate (400k/year).     
* Institutional investors stayed put and let retail investors run in to the slaughter, chasing promises of $1000+ TSLA    
* Tesla insiders dumped their stock during this period       
    
Sadly, the SEC has been in a deep slumber for the past two decades. With the tech industry oligopolies running amok; plus thousands of pump-and-dumps that could only be orchestrated in a now socially-interconnected world, we need their enforcement now more than ever.     
    
Maybe there is some mythical horn we have to blow to rouse the SEC from its slumber. Until then, we can only look at incidents like this and squint at the happenstance. I hope that people far smarter and better researched than myself will look into the Tesla spike and verify that everything is above-board.    
     
""Funding secured""

-----
Edit: Counterpoints
-----

There are a few aspects of this situation that go against my hypothesis that the price was pumped.

* The dump occurred during the Covid-19 outbreak. It is difficult to seperate market manipulation from the general downturn during this period   
* Tesla insiders still hold a large portion of TSLA stock   
* Musk himself purchased stock during the spike. (This is a good point, although I don't believe the stock purchase represents a major buy, considering Musk's enormous wealth. Teslas survival is a point of personal pride to Musk. He has been known to play dirty when his reputation is threatened - he once hired a private investigator to dig up dirt on a dive instructor from Thailand that snubbed him)
* The price rose due to the short squeeze. (This is a counterargument I generally disagree with. The short interest was orders of magnitude smaller than the purchase volume that drove the price to $900+)",NFLX,recent tsla price spike timed perfectly personal investing note wanted put see anyone

The following is an opinion piece posted on **Bloomberg** yesterday. The author, John Authers, essentially make an argument for investors to simply do nothing. 

>Extreme situations create opportunities; they also offer the chance to  lose ungodly sums of money. That is why we need to be careful with what  psychologists call activity bias. It is a natural emotion, [as I have written before](https://www.ft.com/content/7a4c06c4-dbc8-11dc-bc82-0000779fd2ac), and doing nothing requires great self-discipline. But it is often what the situation calls for.

He calls for investors to stop attempting to buy the dip by referring to a [famous op-ed that Warren Buffett wrote for the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/17/opinion/17buffett.html?dbk) during the financial crash urging people to buy more. 

Later on, he cites John C. Bogle's advice on what do during times of volatility in the markets:

>*“My rule — and it’s good only about 99% of the time, so I have to be  careful here — when these crises come along, the best rule you can  possible follow is not “Don’t stand there, do something,” but “Don’t do  something, stand there!”*

#[Today's Top Headlines for Monday, March 23rd, 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/23/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-march-23-2020.html)

> * U.S. stock futures turned strongly positive Monday morning after the Federal Reserve pledged asset purchases with no limit to support markets. Dow futures hit their 5% “limit down” overnight, and were off 600-points at one stage Monday morning, as a massive coronavirus funding package failed a key Senate procedural vote Sunday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average tanked another 900 points or 4.5% on Friday, bringing the weekly decline to over 17% for the worst week since the 2008 financial crisis. Ahead of Monday’s session, the Dow was off more than 35% from last month’s record highs. The New York Stock Exchange’s trading floor will be close starting Monday. The NYSE will go to fully electronic trading. The 10-year Treasury yield, which popped back above 1% last week, was below that level early Monday.

*****

> * Top-level White House and congressional negotiators burned the midnight oil over the now-nearly $2 trillion coronavirus rescue package. Democrats blocked the bill in Sunday’s vote, saying it did too much to bail out companies and not enough to help workers. Several GOP senators, including Rand Paul, who tested positive for the coronavirus, were not present to vote. Others, such as Mitt Romney, were in quarantine as a precaution. The Federal Reserve and Treasury are working on financing programs that could be worth $4 trillion. Goldman Sachs upgraded shares of Boeing, which is hoping for a bailout. Boeing stock has dropped 80% from recent highs on the dual crises of the outbreak and the grounding of its 737 Max.

*****

> * The United States has the third most coronavirus cases in the world, with over 35,000 and 471 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University data. More than half the U.S. cases are in New York, where the death toll increased to 153. Washington state has the second-most cases, with nearly 2,000 confirmed and 95 deaths. New Jersey, California and Illinois round out the top five states. President Donald Trump on Sunday activated the National Guard in New York, Washington state and California in order to combat the spread of the coronavirus. New York plans to run a clinical trial, beginning Tuesday, of a treatment regimen of antimalarial hydroxychloroquine and antibiotic azithromycin, a drug cocktail that has shown promise in fighting the coronavirus.

*****

> * Global coronavirus cases topped 343,000, with 14,789 deaths and over 98,800 recoveries. China, where the outbreak started in December, still has the most cases at over 81,400. China’s 3,274 deaths are second to Italy’s 5,476 deaths. Italy is second in total cases at over 59,100. The U.S., Spain and Germany round out the top five countries. German Chancellor Angela Merkel went into quarantine over the weekend after contact with a doctor who tested positive for the virus. The German government is set to unveil major stimulus measures. Pressure mounts to cancel the Tokyo summer Olympics, set to begin at the end of July. Canada said it won’t send teams to compete. Local media reports indicate that Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is considering a delay.

*****

> * Cisco Systems is committing $225 million to assist in efforts aimed at combating the coronavirus while the rest of Silicon Valley also initiates an investment blitz. 3M said it will supply New York and Seattle with a half-million N95 respirator masks to address the ongoing shortage of health-care equipment. Merck said it will supply New York City with a half-million masks. Chinese billionaire and Alibaba founder Jack Ma sent to Africa 5.4 million face masks, over 1 million testing kits, 40,000 sets of protective clothing and 60,000 protective face shields. BlackRock is committing $50 million in outbreak relief.

913,913,2020-03-26,"If you already have a entry-exit goal for a stock, use a two-legged delayed bull spread for your long term positions instead of limit orders You are cheating yourself by using limit orders. Especially during this volatile period when premiums are... well... at a premium

Let's use a blue chip. The sort of stock found in a stock-based 401k. We are going to invest in MSFT.      


----

*Leg 1: Buy stock*  
Purchase a stock you want to invest in.     

MSFT 146.92     

Normally, you would set a buy limit order (please don't use market orders) at 146 or similar.    

Instead of a limit order, I suggest writing a put.    

Determine how long you are willing to wait to get your microsoft share (assuming this is your retirement account and you will hold the stock for years, you can probably wait months for it). The date you are willing to wait will be your options expiration date.    

So instead you write a put on MSFT at $145 or $150. Lets do $150 expiring on 15 May 2020 (51 days out).     

In exchange for this put, you receive a premium of 12.00 per share.     

At some point, you will be assigned on the put since it is in-the-money. This represents a cool 8% return on your money in 59 days  (57% annualized) before you even own the stock.     

In the unlikely event that you are not assigned (and the option expires), you just write another option and take another sweet premium.   

The downside: 
You are ""locked in"" at the strike price you chose. In this scenario, I chose 150 (closest strike price to 146.92). If the price drops to 140 during the time period, you are still getting MSFT for 150.    

However, if you had done a simple limit order, you would be paying 146 (probably within the day you made the order). You don't get the 12 dollar premium on 150 - making your breakeven price 138.   

*Leg 2: Sell stock*   
Years pass. Seasons change. The old strong oak withers and the young sapling emerges from the morning dew on a fresh spring morning, in the latter years of your life.   

It's time to sell the MSFT stock you were banking on retiring with. MSFT is now at $248.20, and the economy is steady thanks to the efforts of president Beiber.    

How do you sell MSFT traditionally?
Write a slightly in-the-money call with a near-term expiration date.   

We don't know what the prices are today for this, but let's assume we are going to pull the same thing we did on the purchase.   

Normally, we would make a Sell Limit Order at $248 and sell the stock.   

What we do instead is write a call option for  $245, expiring 51 days later. A $12 premium per share is paid to us for the option. The option is in-the-money and will be assigned at some point.    

---    
*So whats the catch?*    

You are getting a premium paid that limits your entry and exit points. You won't get the extra 50 bucks if MSFT suddenly ""moons"" to $300 during the period that you want to sell. You still get your $245 per share and the premium.

If the price moves away from the strike price you could miss the buy or the sale. You would still get paid the premium, and can write another option, for another nice, juicy premium.    

*What does all this mean?*   
It means you are being paid for selecting a buy and a sell price. If you know what you are willing to pay for the stock, and what you will accept to sell it - and hold fast to those prices,  you get a premium return as a reward.

You have sold the ""dream"" prices of a $50 buy and $300 sale to the speculators. Only they will reap the excess rewards of your stock if something crazy happens to the share price in a short period. People on WSB and speculator discord channels will pay you a healthy chunk of cash to use your shares betting on moonshots that typically will lose them money.    

Flakey investors will chase prices up and down with limit orders, and are not getting the premium price afforded to people who choose their prices and stick with them.     

*Options are dangerous and can lose tons of money!*   
False. Options can create leverage or reduce leverage. They can be the safest or riskiest investments, depending on how you build your spread. This bull spread strategy actually reduces your leverage.

You are actually reducing your exposure and risk to the market. Stock buyers who use a basic limit order are paying more money for the ""unlimited gain"" possibility.

924,924,2020-04-02,"Apple Shipments, How Much Could It Fall Amid Coronavirus Outbreak?  Without a doubt, the COVID-19 pandemic has roiled equity markets. And the downtrend trajectory that started in late February might extend further in the near term as governments continue to take stocks of the economic impact of the outbreak. Some countries have closed their borders and announced lockdowns. Thus, consumers are spending less on non-essential goods and services and delaying purchases. Then, they expect this to hit the top line of a few companies by a significant margin. A tech giant, set to face a considerable drop in revenue, is Apple. The firm makes the majority of its flagship product, the iPhone. Last December quarter, iPhone sales increased by 7.7% to $56.0 billion and accounted for 61% of overall revenue. With that, the demand for the company's new lineup of smartphones mainly driven the growth. However, on February 17, Apple unveiled a statement confirming that the firm will miss the quarterly guidance issued during the last earnings call. Also, Apple attributed the shortfall to a constrained iPhone supply and a slow production ramp-up in its manufacturing sites in China. These headwinds have the capacity to depress Apple's results beyond the current quarter.

934,934,2020-04-09,"Why the stock market is going up... and it's not because the Coronavirus is going away I think I know why the stock market is up... and it's not because the Coronavirus is going away.

It requires some macroeconomic and finance knowledge, but maybe, just maybe:

* Fed actions (buying assets) are lowering risk premiums
* Fed actions (lowering rates) are lowering asset yields overall
* Both of these actions lower stock yields, which increases stock prices
* Lower stock yields = longer duration for stocks (dividend discount model)
* Longer duration + lower stock yields = less overall sensitivity to the lower expected earnings for next 12-24 months due to Coronavirus
* Plus... a maybe.... maybe long-term inflation expectations due to printing money = higher earnings (in pure dollar terms) for cash flows 5-30 years from now

Run those things through a discounted cash-flow model, and you get higher stock prices.  Near-term earnings become less important to the overall picture.

The absolute weirdness of finance.

Spreadsheet that helps explain it: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tdem96CqM4leh7eJU5U7ZVOsGmkouB4Mcx0MsfbQa8M/edit?usp=sharing

____________________________________________________

**EDIT #1:**  The spreadsheet doesn't tell us what S&P 500 is going to be.  That is NOT it's purpose.  It shows us how Fed actions can increase stock prices, all other things staying the same.

^^ Look at the spreadsheet and don’t take it literally... it’s a demonstration of yield change, not a market prediction... ^^

____________________________________________________

**EDIT#2:**

ELI5:

US Government actions are making it less risky to be in the stock market.

US Government actions are also making it harder to make money in bonds.  Stocks now pay much better than bonds.

The logical conclusion is that yield-chasers are buying stocks, and they believe we will solve Coronavirus before the Fed runs out of ammo.

935,935,2020-04-09,"Apple will tank, and the market will follow Okay, hear me out,  [u/Controlthenarrative](https://www.reddit.com/u/Controlthenarrative/) wasn't wrong to short Apple, he was just too early, like a true genius autist. Here is why I think Apple will tank in the coming months.

I will be using AAPL prices from closing from today and AAPL's financial statements.

AAPL closed today $267.99, and it has a ttm EPS of 12.60, so it's trading at a trailing PE of 21.27, which is way too high if you compare it to how Apple trades historically. Apple usually has a PE ratio of between 12-15, just take a look at this chart:

[https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AAPL/apple/pe-ratio](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AAPL/apple/pe-ratio)

Alright, so now the question is what will be Apple's earnings in the future, since forward PE is what investors think about when investing (I know you autists don't tho, don't worry). Assuming earnings STAY THE SAME (which they won't) this year for Apple, fair value for the stock should be around:

$12.60 x 15 = $189

So Apple is trading at a premium of $79, or around 40%. And that's if they have the same earnings as last year. Okay, so let's took a look at their earnings:

[https://s2.q4cdn.com/470004039/files/doc\_financials/2020/q1/Q1-FY20-Consolidated-Financial-Statements.pdf](https://s2.q4cdn.com/470004039/files/doc_financials/2020/q1/Q1-FY20-Consolidated-Financial-Statements.pdf)

Looking at their net sales, $91,819,000,000, all services only represents $12,715,000,000, or about 13.85% of their net sales. All the rest comes from sales of iPhones, Macs, iPads, and accessories. Let's say that the services portion remains the same, or even grows, this year, I can't imagine their sales of phones, computers and accessories not getting hit by the virus. Now I'm no prophet, and I'm certainly not an insider, so I can't tell how much sales will be affected, but it sure as hell will be affected in a big way for at least 1 trimester, if not 2-3. You think even after the virus is gone people will go back to buying iPhones? Hell no, they'll be behind on all their bills are buying a new iPhone will not be their priority, and even fucking Jerome can't print enough money to cover everyone's bills (although I often underestimate his BRRRRRRRR). With retail sales representing over 85% of Apple's net sales, their EPS for Q2 and Q3 will be awful, thus the share price will tank.

If they get an EPS of like 10 this year, fair price would be $150, but it will probably trade at like $175-190 since people will look at 2021 earnings.

So the true question: when will it tank? I sadly do not have an answer, but maybe after they report Q1 earnings and come up with their guidance. If not, after Q2 earnings.

So position: Apple puts, 1 month after Q1 earnings if you feel ballsy, or 1 month after Q2 earnings. I say 1 month after so you won't get killed too much by theta.

Bonus prediction: Big tech that are dependent on ad revenue will also tank (Facebook and Google) since most of their revenue comes from ads and ads & marketing is the first thing that gets cut when a company is bleeding cash. So Apple with big tech that are dependent on ad tanking will bring down the whole SPY since tech is now over 30% of the SPY. Other companies in the SPY will follow them down since people will be panicking, but not enough to bring the VIX back up to 80, so careful with your options, fellow autist.

Sorry for the long post, I know this is a MacDonald's

TLDR: Apple will fall below $200 sometimes in the next 6 months. Either hold cash if you lost too much money are too fearful to lose more, or puts expiring 1 month after Q2 earnings, or 1 month after Q1 earnings if you feel courageous. SPY will follow afterward.",AAPL,apple tank market follow okay hear ucontrolthenarrativehttpswwwredditcomucontrolthenarrative wasnt wrong short apple early like true genius autist think apple tank coming month using aapl price closing today aapls financial statement aapl closed today 26799 ttm eps 1260 trading trailing pe 2127 way high compare apple trade historically apple usually pe ratio 1215 take look chart httpswwwmacrotrendsnetstockschartsaaplappleperatiohttpswwwmacrotrendsnetstockschartsaaplappleperatio alright question apple earnings future since forward pe investor think investing know autists dont tho dont worry assuming earnings stay wont year apple fair value stock around 1260 x 15 189 apple trading premium 79 around 40 thats earnings last year okay let took look earnings httpss2q4cdncom470004039filesdocfinancials2020q1q1fy20consolidatedfinancialstatementspdfhttpss2q4cdncom470004039filesdocfinancials2020q1q1fy20consolidatedfinancialstatementspdf looking net sale 91819000000 service represents 12715000000 1385 net sale rest come sale iphones mac ipads accessory let say service portion remains even grows year cant imagine sale phone computer accessory getting hit virus im prophet im certainly insider cant tell much sale affected sure hell affected big way least 1 trimester 23 think even virus gone people go back buying iphones hell theyll behind bill buying new iphone priority even fucking jerome cant print enough money cover everyones bill although often underestimate brrrrrrrr retail sale representing 85 apple net sale eps q2 q3 awful thus share price tank get eps like 10 year fair price would 150 probably trade like 175190 since people look 2021 earnings true question tank sadly answer maybe report q1 earnings come guidance q2 earnings position apple put 1 month q1 earnings feel ballsy 1 month q2 earnings say 1 month wont get killed much theta bonus prediction big tech dependent ad revenue also tank facebook google since revenue come ad ad marketing first thing get cut company bleeding cash apple big tech dependent ad tanking bring whole spy since tech 30 spy company spy follow since people panicking enough bring vix back 80 careful option fellow autist sorry long post know macdonalds tldr apple fall 200 sometimes next 6 month either hold cash lost much money fearful lose put expiring 1 month q2 earnings 1 month q1 earnings feel courageous spy follow afterward,Negative,-0.1843

Today I'll show you an example of how to do this. Keep in mind this is not financial advise and you shouldn't buy some random puts because some person on the internet said it might print in a week; do your own DD. Ok let's begin

**Inspiration**

It's obvious that small businesses are fucked. PPP and EIDL grants, which is meant to sustain small businesses until they can re-open, is a mess with the vast majority of businesses still not getting the money. Even with these loans, it might give small businesses a month or two of extra cash, it won’t be sustainable if we keep needing to lockdown the economy for the next 18 months until a vaccine is introduced.

So let’s use that fact to see what we should take short positions in. What stock has the most exposure to small businesses? $YELP. Let’s look at a breakdown of their financials for the year ended 2019 from their most recent 10-K. Let’s look at some select pieces of their financials to see how they’re doing.

**10-K Deep Dive**

*Income Statement*

|Revenue|1B (970M from ads, 30M from other)|
|:-|:-|
|Cost of Revenue|62M|
|Operating Expenses|977M (Sales: 500M, Product Dev: 230M, G&A: 135M, Depreciation: 50M)|
|Operating Income|35M|
|Net Income|50M|

Effectively all of their revenue is coming from ads. Another interesting fact here is that for every $1 of revenue they’re getting, they had to spend $0.50 in sales. Let’s take a closer look at where this ad money is coming from.

*Revenue Sources*

|Home & Local Services|35%|
|:-|:-|
|Restaurants|14%|
|Beauty & Fitness|12%|
|Health|10%|
|Shopping|8%|
|Other|21%|

Yelp recently announced on April 9 that 1000 employees are being laid off and 1100 are being furloughed, presumably mostly sales, out of a total of over 6000 employees. Also, in the period between Mar 10 - April 9, it has also seen page views for restaurants drop 64%, nightlife 81%, fitness 73% and beauty 83%. Clearly their revenue's going to be fucked for Q1 and Q2, and won't be recovering for a while.

*Balance Sheet*

|Current Assets|533M (Cash: 170M, Securities: 242M, AC: 107M)|
|:-|:-|
|Total Assets|1B|
|Current Liabilities|134M|
|Total Liabilities|315M (Only LT liability being leases)|
|Stockholders Equity|755M|

They’ve actually come into this crisis with a balance sheet that most public companies can only dream of. They literally have no debt (aside from leases), and ALOT of liquid assets, mostly from the giant influx they received from GrubHub when they sold Eat24 to them for $288M. They’re at no risk of bankruptcy, being able to survive at least 6 months with no revenue without cutting anything back with their liquid assets alone. But this is where the good news ends for $YELP investors.

**Yelp - The Sick Company of the Tech industry**

Here’s their stock performance since their IPO in 2012

[$YELP 2012 - 2020, monthly](https://preview.redd.it/zeenp3nr4xs41.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=c162aede36deada90444a1adf511cfcf0fa896c4)

Even before COVID-19, their stock price has barely increased since their IPO. Their IPO price was $22 in early 2012. In January 2020, it was trading at around $35, representing an increase of 36% over 8 of the best years in the stock market’s history, especially for tech stocks like Yelp. In comparison QQQ grew by nearly 230% in the same time period.

Yelp was founded in 2004, around the same time as Facebook. If Yelp was going to have an explosive growth period, like what almost every other tech company, they probably would have had it by now after 8 years since their IPO. Instead, this is the kind of growth they’ve been seeing in their 2019 fiscal year.

|Operating Income|\+37%|
|Net Income|\-26%|
|Current Assets|\-38%|
|Liabilities|\+215%|
|Stockholders Equity|\-30%|
|EPS|\-16%|

So they’re struggling to grow revenue, especially for a medium-cap technology company. Not only that but their earnings and equity is decreasing in what should have been a great year for small businesses and the economy, signaling that the company is slowly dying. They’ve also given up on international expansion and are focusing on protecting their US market share from Google, and it looks like they’re losing.

It also looks like they’ve also spent an enormous amount of their Eat24 cash last year, but it clearly didn’t go towards growth, so where did it all go?

**Propping up the $YELP share price**

During 2019, Yelp has spent $481M (20% of its Jan 2020 market cap) to buy back 14M shares, 20% of its 71M shares outstanding. For perspective, competitors $GOOG and $TRIP each repurchased less than 2.5% of their shares during the same time period. Instead of using that cash to grow their operations, they’ve been using it to artificially prop up their stock. Now, even with a strong balance sheet, they’re going to need all the liquidity they need to avoid having to shrink their already dying operations, and have announced suspending their stock repurchasing program. It’s pretty easy to see the distortion in the valuation of their stock that’s been caused by their stock manipulation - just look at its P/E ratios compared to its competitors.

Using April 14 prices

|$YELP|37|
|:-|:-|
|$GOOG|26|
|$TRIP|20|
|$NDAQ|22|

Using Jan 1 prices

|$YELP|67|
|:-|:-|
|$GOOG|26|
|$TRIP|34|
|$NDAQ|23|

Seems pretty overvalued to me. Now that they’ve stopped their stock repurchasing, we’ll slowly see $YELP fall towards it’s true fair value.

**Price Target**

They’re not going bankrupt, but this recession / depression will definitely accelerate the death of their operations, a process that started when Google first released Google Reviews. As of right now, it’s worth at least the book value of their equity - a 755M market cap, or $10.50 per share. Another simple way to look at it is to apply the PE ratio of its most similar competitor in terms of size and revenue disruption, $TRIP, which would give it a true value of $10.55. Of course, this is using their balance sheet and earnings from 2019, which has probably already been feeling the effects of the lockdown. Their next earnings call is expected to be 5/14, so we’ll see the real damage then.

**Technicals**

This won't be a true wsb DD without drawing some magic lines on the price charts, so I'll do a brief rundown of what I see from my horoscope.

[$YELP, daily](https://preview.redd.it/ikp9abvp4xs41.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=80b1e57304335852cdef4b5e24c9fd1d6fd24c1f)

$YELP has been roughly following the trends of the stock market as a whole since the crash began, but we’re now starting to see actual price discovery in the market (eg. $AMZN hit a new ATH today). It’s currently in an upwards trend towards $22, which has historically been a strong support / resistance level for the past few years, is the 38% retracement level, and is also their original IPO price. It looks like they will fail to break the $22 resistance, fall through the ascending trendline, and resume plummeting before the end of next week.

**TLDR; Learn to be literate. YELP 15p 8/21**

947,947,2020-04-15,"Cookin' (The Books) With $TSLA: Fuzzy's EBITDA Explainer Hello, friends -

It's me, Fuzzy. Welcome back. I know, I know. I'm excited too. I had this up at market open but it got spiked by automod \*twice\* so I'm hoping third time's the charm. 

Did you guys see that movie, *The Accountant*? The one where [Sad Ben Affleck](https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5ab58b2922f093031d9fb8fa/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/Fry-The-Great-Sadness-of-Ben-Affleck.jpg) plays an autistic accountant for organized crime who doubles as a stone-cold killer? Yeah, me neither.  I mainly remember it exists because it features Anna Kendrick, a Fuzzy Fave (TM). In the March Madness for my heart, she's a 4 or 5 seed in her conference for sure (look out, u/pokimane). Anyway, that's what we're going to be talking about today. No, not March Madness (never got the fuss) or Sad Ben Affleck (21st century existential icon) - not even Fuzzy's Faves. Today, we're all about bean-counting - specifically, EBITDA, the magic number that makes all of your accounting problems disappear. I figured it was time you autists got to learnin' how businesses can lose money on paper but still be in the green with their creditors - especially at the moment, what with the bat flu and all, when many businesses are trying to explain that no one should panic and they're still in the black (even though they're definitely not). Let's get started.

Now - disclaimer - I am **not** an accountant (obviously). If you are, feel free to flex in the comments and explain to me how mastery of forward-looking deduction writeoffs or some other fucking word jumble would make me a more complete human and save me $0.03 on my taxes every second five-year rolling addback window. The thing is, like most people that wind up on the human facing side of the finance industry, I cared too much about getting laid in college to give a shit about how to make numbers dance on a P/L statement, so I never really bothered to learn much more than the basics.  Once you hit the real world, though, those pocket-protecting calculator jockeys get preeeetty important, pretty fast. Tax, forensics, regular ol' corporate book-keeping - in business-land, you name it, you need an accountant to either do it for you or sign off on it before you send it to the board. So, you know, accountants. Not all bad.

Anyway, even though I'm not an accountant, one thing I **do** know a lot about is EBITDA. Why? Because it's one of the most hotly contested battlegrounds of modern corporate finance, so I deal with it every day. ""But Fuzzy! How can you negotiate something that's an established accounting concept? Isn't that like trying to change 2+2 so it equals 5?"" And the answer - if EBITDA was a regular accounting concept - would be yes. But fortunately for borrowers, private equity cowboys and corporate finance lawyers (as well as lovers of weasel words everywhere), it's not, so you can. See, there's a difference between GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) and... well everything that's not GAAP. You can't fuck with GAAP. How something \*becomes\* or even \*became\* GAAP in the first place... unclear. I guess in ancient times some bespectacled prophet came down from Mt. Nerd with spreadsheets carved on stone tablets, and whatever was on them wound up being generally accepted. I don't know, I'm not a fucking theologian. But however it happened, you can't fuck with it. Happily, though, EBITDA is non-GAAP, so like all the best girls, it's whatever you want it to be.

But we're getting ahead of ourselves. Today's post is going to be a tale of two halves. We're going to go through what EBITDA is and why it's important, and then we're going to go through a meme-tastic example to show how it can be manipulated - using everyone's favorite manufacturer of tendie-powered cars, rocketships, and flamethrowers... $TSLA!

If you want to play along at home, here's [$TSLA's 10-K](https://ir.tesla.com/static-files/07bfcb70-aba1-4a27-af09-4f101678320c). Now I know people get all hot and bothered about $TSLA for whatever reason (did you know there's a dedicated Tesla investors subreddit? fucking weird). So let's get this clear from the jump - every single company does this, and I'm not implying that $TSLA is doing anything 'wrong' or 'bad'. I don't give a shit about the ticker or the cars or Elon's mission to put weed on Mars or whatever the fuck he's doing these days, so don't come at me in the comments about any of that shit. They're just the example we're using to work through this exercise. They've actually got a fascinating debt structure that is worthy of its own post (Musk or his family can take it private at any point without triggering a change of control under the docs... what?!), but today we're limiting our scope to the way they're allowed to calculate EBITDA.

OK. Ready? Let's do this. Sincere and/or funny questions in the comments answered as always.

1. **EBITDA - A User's Guide**

When it comes to people, it's pretty easy to measure performance. Where you went to school, how much you make, where you live, how hot your wife is, how long... you get the idea. The point is that life is full of concrete, objective measures to help you figure out how worthwhile (or not) you really are as a human. Stretch out to the ""All Time"" view on your RH graph to give yourself an idea of where you sit.

Businesses have a bunch of these metrics they can look at. Profits, cashflow, sales... the list goes on. The issues with most of those, though, is that running a business is a pretty complicated job. There's a whole lot of shit that goes into those numbers each financial year, and not all of it is necessarily indicative of the 'normal' baseline of performance. Maybe you have a bad quarter because of the 'rona (pour one out for $WFC..... yikes). Maybe you get slugged with a tax bill, or a big interest repayment from your bank. Now that might hurt your operating profit on a one-off basis, but it's not something you expect to keep happening. You don't want your shareholders to freak out over nothing. That's where EBITDA comes in (say it like EEE-BIT-DAH).

EBITDA stands for **E**arnings **B**efore **I**nterest **T**axes **D**epreciation and **A**mortization. The idea is essentially to find that baseline - to produce a number which reflects the true earnings of the business when the pernicious influence of taxes, financing, and accounting is taken out of the equation. Basically, you calculate it by **adding back** non-cash expenses to your baseline operating income. That's it. Simple, right? ""OK Fuzz, but what's a non-cash expense? Couldn't that be like... anything?"" Exactly.

Because EBITDA as a concept is more malleable than your more... black and white metrics, borrowers like to use it in loan documentation - particularly in leveraged finance, where it typically serves as the measure of earnings for the company. It's also used as a building block of incurrence baskets - the higher your EBITDA, the more you get to utilize under a particular basket. Usually this is done by way of a either/or construct - you can have $50 million **or** $25%  (or whatever) of your EBITDA, whichever is greater. It also turns up in financial covenants and step-downs in asset sale sweeps, excess cash flow sweeps, and pricing. There's a bunch of other non-finance ways it gets used too, but we're just going to stick to this for now.

Sometimes companies will try and flex their 'record EBITDA' numbers in a 10-K. But if you read on, you'll see  that every time they do this, it's qualified by the fact that it's non-GAAP and not accepted blah blah blah. So just be mindful of that when you're reviewing those documents and always read the real numbers before you make a call on how the business is actually doing.

Anyway, let's see how it can be manipulated.

2. **Cookin' With Elon - The $TSLA Example**

Let's take a peek under the hood of [$TSLA's Credit Agreement](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000119312519095913/d625340dex1068.htm) to see what's going on with their EBITDA. Remember how I said you could calculate EBITDA by just adding back non-cash expenses to operating income? That's right... in theory. Have a look at this (just skim it, reading it cold will give you a headache. I'm going to break it down for you anyway - this is just for illustrative purposes):

>“Consolidated EBITDA” shall mean, for any period, Consolidated Net Income for such period (without giving effect to (w) any extraordinary gains or losses, (x) any non-cash income, (y) any gains or losses from sales of assets other than those assets sold in the ordinary course of business, or (z) any foreign currency gains or losses) adjusted by (A) adding thereto (in each case to the extent deducted in determining Consolidated Net Income for such period (other than clause (ix) below which need not be so deducted)), without duplication, the amount of (i) total interest expense (inclusive of amortization or write-off of deferred financing fees and other original issue discount and banking fees, charges and commissions (e.g., letter of credit issuance and facing fees (including Letter of Credit Fees and Facing Fees), commitment fees, issuance costs and other transactional costs)) of the Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries determined on a consolidated basis for such period, (ii) provision for taxes based on income and foreign withholding taxes for the Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries (including state, franchise, capital and similar taxes paid or accrued) determined on a consolidated basis for such period, (iii) all depreciation and amortization expense of the Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries determined on a consolidated basis for such period, (iv) in the case of any period, the amount of all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Transaction (including in connection with any amendments to the Credit Documents) during such fiscal quarter, (v) any unusual or non-recurring cash charges, (vi) any cash restructuring charges or reserves (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall include retention, severance, system establishment costs, excess pension charges, contract and lease termination costs and costs to consolidate facilities and relocate employees) for such period (a)(x) incurred in connection with an Acquisition consummated after the Effective Date or (y) otherwise incurred in connection with the Company’s and its Consolidated Subsidiaries’ operations in an aggregate amount for all cash charges added back pursuant to this clause (vi) not to exceed 15% of Consolidated EBITDA in any Test Period (calculated before giving effect to this clause (vi)), (vii) any expenses incurred in connection with any actual or proposed Investment, incurrence, amendment or repayment of Indebtedness, issuance of Equity Interests or acquisition or disposition, in each case, outside the ordinary course of business for such period, (viii) expenses incurred to the extent covered by indemnification provisions in any agreement in connection with an acquisition to the extent reimbursed in cash to the Company or any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries and such indemnification payments are not otherwise included in Consolidated Net Income, in each case, for such period, (ix) proceeds received by the Company or any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries from any business interruption insurance to the extent such proceeds are not otherwise included in such Consolidated Net Income for such period, (x) all other non-cash charges of the Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries determined on a consolidated basis for such period, (xi) \[RESERVED\], and (xii) any expenses associated with stock based compensation and (B) subtracting therefrom (to the extent not otherwise deducted in determining Consolidated Net Income for such period) (i) the amount of all cash payments or cash charges made (or incurred) by the Company or any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries for such period on account of any non-cash charges added back to Consolidated EBITDA pursuant to preceding sub-clause (A)(x) in a previous period and (ii) any unusual or non-recurring cash gains. For the avoidance of doubt, it is understood and agreed that, to the extent any amounts are excluded from Consolidated Net Income by virtue of the proviso to the definition thereof contained herein, any add backs to Consolidated Net Income in determining Consolidated EBITDA as provided above shall be limited (or denied) in a fashion consistent with the proviso to the definition of Consolidated Net Income contained herein

Yowza. That's a mouthful, huh? So in this bullshit alphabet soup are some key phrases that we are going to look at to see how businesses can manipulate their YOY figures to appear a bit... better than they would be otherwise. There are your normal should be in there things too, but most is bullshit. Let's pick out the five big ones. My comments on how these can be manipulated are in ALL CAPS after each one.

(1) Transaction costs (with respect to both closing date transactions and other permitted transactions) THIS BASICALLY MEANS THEY CAN SPEND HOWEVER MUCH MONEY THEY WANT ON WHATEVER THEY WANT AS LONG AS IT'S ALLOWED UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT AND THEY CAN ADD IT BACK. THEY CAN ALSO INCLUDE ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH LAWYERS (BECAUSE WE'RE EXPENSIVE), ACCOUNTANTS, CONSULTANTS, WITCH DOCTORS, STRIPPERS... YOU GET THE IDEA. THIS IS ONE WAY THAT CASHFLOW NEGATIVE COMPANIES CAN HAVE A POSITIVE EBITA - YOU SPEND EVERYTHING ON MORE SHIT AND YOU GET CREDITED FOR IT. TSLA ARE A CLASSIC EXAMPLE OF A COMPANY THAT WOULD USE THIS ALL THE TIME BECAUSE THEY ARE ALWAYS IN ACQUISITION OR DEVELOPMENT MODE. ALL THAT CRAZY SHIT ELON DOES THAT PISSES AWAY MONEY WOULD GO RIGHT HERE AS A CREDIT TO THE BUSINESS.

(2) Cash restructuring charges / reserves (capped at 15% of EBITDA) DOWNSIZING, CONSOLIDATION, FURLOUGHING PEOPLE, PAYING TO GET PEOPLE KILLED - IF IT MEANS A CHANGE TO YOUR BUSINESS THAT INVOLVES MOVING PEOPLE AROUND OR GETTING RID OF THEM, YOU CAN ADD IT BACK HERE. SAME GOES FOR CASH RESERVES YOU'VE ESTABLISHED. GET A DOUBLE CREDIT FOR SPENDING **AND** NOT SPENDING MONEY!

(3) Pro forma cost savings projected to be realized from any material business acquisition (exceeding > of $60 million / 1% of total assets) THIS ONE IS ALWAYS FUNNY TO ME. THE IDEA IS THAT IF YOU BUY SOMETHING THAT COMPLEMENTS YOUR EXISTING BUSINESS, EVEN IF IT IS SOMETHING THAT IS ACTIVELY LOSING MONEY, YOU CAN GET A CREDIT FOR THE SYNERGIES IT WILL HAVE WITH YOUR EXISTING BUSINESS. COMBINE WITH ADDBACK (1) ABOVE FOR A REALLY GOO TIME - DOUBLE DIP ON BUYING CASH BURNING BUSINESSES AND JUST TELL PEOPLE IT'S SYNERGISTIC. WOO, FISCAL HEALTH AND WELLBEING!

(4) extraordinary losses PRETTY MUCH WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE. IF SOMETHING FEELS WEIRD TO YOU, YOU CAN PROBABLY ADD IT BACK HERE. THERE IS NO BASELINE FOR THIS. IT'S WHATEVER YOU WANT IT TO BE AT ANY POINT IN TIME AND THE BANK CAN'T STOP YOU.

(5) unusual and/or non-recurring cash charges WHERE YOU CLAIM WRITEOFFS FOR YOUR CEO'S WIFE'S BOYFRIEND'S SECRET FAMILY IN OMAHA'S CHRISTMAS PRESENTS. YOU CAN SERIOUSLY USE THIS FOR WHATEVER YOU WANT AS LONG AS YOU CAN SAY IT'S (I) NOT SOMETHING YOU'D DO EVERY DAY AND (II) IT PROBABLY WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN. INTERESTINGLY SOME BUSINESSES ARE TRYING TO CLAIM CORONA-RELATED CREDITS HERE TO STEER THEM THROUGH THIS EARNINGS SEASON WITHOUT HAVING TO DEAL WITH NEGATIVE EBITDA.

This is just $TSLA, and honestly their definition isn't even that complicated. Seriously - go to your favorite ticker's 10-K, find the credit agreement, and CTRL+F ""Consolidated EBITDA"" and ""Consolidated Net Income"". Try and read it for yourself and tell me if you think that makes up anything other than a shitty madlib - let alone a real performance metric for a business.

Anyway. That's today's post. $LYV breakdown later in the week. $LULU on Friday.

962,962,2020-04-19,"Created a list of undervalued stocks for you guys Each company is rated based on three different metrics: price to book value, quarterly earnings, forwardEps minus trailingEps

The lower rating the better. Each rating is summed to give the total rating.   

For example all s&amp;p500 companies are sorted by priceToBookValue ratio. The number 1 company receives 1 point the number 2 company receives 2 points and so forth.  

This is repeated for the other two metrics. 

It would be nice if a company excelled at all three metrics and only received 3 points total but that's not realistic. A low profit to book value means the company stock price is under valued. If such a company also has good quarterly earnings growth and a good forward outlook then it is super under valued. And that is the point of this exercise.

Edit: this one divides eps by stock share price so we can get a more accurate picture of earnings per dollar. By doing this I noticed DAL was kind of high on the list so i'm going to add another metric of profit margin to try and weed out companies that have less cash to work with and may be at risk for bankruptcy. 

doc (removed)


Edit 2:

Ok I think this one is the most accurate. Instead of using trailing and forward eps and dividing by stock price I'm just using forwardPE. I also take into account pegRatio and if either PE or pegRatio are negative the company gets dinged hard (like with dal or luv).

So this gives us a list of companies that will survive the pandemic and are under priced.

Enjoy!

doc (removed)


Edit 3:

Added more details here including market price, earnings date, industry, and analyst recommendations. Even if the stock appears undervalued these analysts may know more than i do. You can go down the list and pick all the strong buys. Should be a good deal!

I added the industry because I plan on making a ""diversified"" portfolio out of this

Edit 4:

With this list I severely penalized any company that had negative earnings or growth. The top 318 companies are clearly set apart from the bottom companies.

Edit 5:

Same as above with severe penalty but in addition to having a column for priceToBook I also included one for 52WeekAverage which will give more weight to those stocks that were hardest hit. So this is is the real gem here. It should have companies with a positive future earning outlook with the lowest price.

Edit 6:

Same as above but sorted by industry so you can make your own portfolio. Pick the first one or two stocks from each industry. I also put analyst ratings next to my rating. Higher is better. Note this spreadsheet contains ALL companies in the s&p 500. I'm not saying they're all buys. 

Make a copy of this spreadsheet and delete the bottom half from each industry and you'd have a solid portfolio of stocks that are on the cheap

I didn’t really like Reed Hastings before, but after he destroyed what should have been a rally for NFLX, while I was trying to trade on earnings, I like him a lot less. Of course, not that he cares or that the market cares.

It seems crazy to me, that the focus of his Q1 earnings report that he choose to focus on having a negative outlook? Dude, you just raised you subscriber base about 20% and you are more profitable than you have ever been. You DOUBLED the highest estimates of every forecast on sub gains.

In fact, by his own guidance, they still have guidance to obtain another 7 million subs and higher earnings per share in Q2.

Furthermore, he praised!!! Disney plus. NFLX is getting beat up pre market and Dis is outperforming. 

And all his words are cautionary for the future of NFLX, despite his own guidance for next quarter being respectable gains. 

Can you imagine, DIS announcing upon reaching 50m subscriber: well we had a good run we aren’t sure what we’re going to do to retain these customers or ever bring Disney plus to be profitable. 

Or how about WMT: we’ve had significant grocery gains and e commerce gains, but we expect to lose more of our business to amazon in Q2.

Both statements are likely true, but who says that shit? 

Pure insanity. You don’t have to lie about the future of NFLX. I don’t think anyone was anticipating 15m subs and surely no is anticipating 15m subs in Q2, but how about just talk about a strategy to retain the customers and how your going to use the increased revenue to continue to make the service reach a larger audience or become more profitable. Nope, gloom and doom. In maybe, the best quarter the company has EVER seen since 1997.

A lot of people are looking for the hot, sexy young stock that will beat the market and double within 5 years, but sometimes the best plays are also the most obvious. It's easy to believe ""small company will grow faster than big company"" but the large cap growth companies have economies of scale and extremely high amounts of capital to invest in both their products and expanding their market share. They also have stability, great management and brand recognition, which breeds investor confidence and makes people feel safe entrusting their money to them.

This also suggests that index funds may be safe and diversified, but if a blue chip growth company is worthy of your confidence, you're potentially better off not over-diversifying away your returns. Note: if any one of these companies completely failed and fell off the map somehow, assuming no impact one way or another to the others, the total returns of the other two would still have beaten SPY WITH that company included by a significant amount - even if the vanished company was Microsoft, the biggest returner.

**EDIT:**

I will be posting a longer term analysis shortly following this methodology back historically using the top 3 US market cap companies based on the Q1 values of the [Financial Times Global 500 each year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_public_corporations_by_market_capitalization). I compare buying and holding $1000 worth of shares of each of the top 3 companies each year since 1996 (when the Global 500 started) on market open Jan 1st of that year vs. buying and holding $3000 worth of SPY on the same day, with no dividend reinvestments either way. Following this methodology:

Cash basis: $75,000 (25 years x $3000)

The ""Big 3"" portfolio: $199,445

SPY portfolio: $165,164

This is including buying and holding declining behemoths like GE, CSCO and XOM which are lower today than when they were at the top.

978,978,2020-04-25,"""Big 3 investing"" has beaten the S&P 500 the past 25 years I have done an analysis comparing purchasing the top 3 US market cap companies every year on January 1st and holding until today vs. purchasing the same amount of SPY on January 1st and holding until today (close price on 4/24/2020.)

To determine ""top 3 market cap"" I used the Q1 values in [Financial Times' Global 500 list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_public_corporations_by_market_capitalization). Since the FT Global 500 list started in 1996, that is where I begin.

In my **Big 3 Portfolio**, I purchase $1000 worth of each that year's top 3 market capitalization companies at their Jan 1st open price.

In my **SPY Portfolio**, I purchase $3000 a year of SPY (S&P 500 tracking index, aka ""the market"") at it's Jan 1st open price.

Thus the total cash basis of 25 annual batches of $3000 is $75,000 for each portfolio.

I found that the Big 3 Portfolio beat the SPY portfolio by about **$34,281.34, 20.75% over the value of the final SPY Portfolio value.**

*IMPORTANT NOTES:*

* *After pulling all the data, I realized the faulty assumption of this study is that the FT500 market cap ranking is posted on January 1st to know which 3 companies to purchase for that year. I have no idea what day it was posted, and if the years before the FT500 went to quarterly rankings were later in the year it might be showing more in hindsight instead of foresight. In hindsight, I probably should have purchased the previous year's top picks those early years and the previous Q4 picks after the survey went quarterly. May do a version 2 along those lines at some point.*
* *I do not reinvest -- or even count -- dividends. I may include that on a version 2.0. Factoring in dividends (especially if you are reinvesting at market price on the day of issuance) and their potential tax implications for each of the 75 lots would make the analysis significantly more complex.*
* *I used fractional shares (i.e. however many shares you could have purchased with exactly $1000). That might not have been possible when this started but is possible now.*
* *This assumes no additional buying or selling beyond the initial annual purchase with new capital. There is NO REALIGNMENT (which would involve cap gains, etc.). This is pure dollar cost averaging. Another analysis worth doing might consider cashing out companies that drop out of the top 3 on the last day of the year and buying the new ones taking their place with the profits you have built up so far in a non-taxable account like a Roth. This would keep you from holding companies like GE and Exxon as they decline might lead to bigger returns, I'd guess.*

Here are my findings, broken down into combined annual lots of $3000 for each portfolio.

The annual Big 3 lot beat the annual SPY lot long-term 19 out of 25 years. This is very heavily indebted to Microsoft offsetting many years of Exxon and GE being top 3 companies which are now in major decline. On the individual stock side, it wasn't nearly as lopsided: 38 of 75 batches beat $1000 worth of SPY purchased on the same day, 37 did not. As we slip into the past decade, the ratio of underperformers number drops drastically, with 25 batches outperforming the market and 8 underperforming it.

Microsoft (21 years), Apple (11 years) Amazon (2 years) and Google (3 years) beat the matching SPY lot every single year it made the list.

Exxon Mobil (19 years), GE (13 years), Cisco (1 year), Chevron (1 year), Wal-mart (1 year) and Coca-Cola (1 year) to date lost to the equivalent SPY lot every single year they made the list.

Berkshire split, with one year beating the market and one year losing to it.

To determine ""top 3 market cap"" I used the Q1 values in [Financial Times' Global 500 list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_public_corporations_by_market_capitalization). Since the FT Global 500 list started in 1996, that is where I begin.

In my **Big 3 Portfolio**, I purchase $1000 worth of each that year's top 3 market capitalization companies at their Jan 1st open price.

In my **SPY Portfolio**, I purchase $3000 a year of SPY (S&P 500 tracking index, aka ""the market"") at it's Jan 1st open price.

Thus the total cash basis of 25 annual batches of $3000 is $75,000 for each portfolio.

I found that the Big 3 Portfolio beat the SPY portfolio by about **$34,281.34, 20.75% over the value of the final SPY Portfolio value.**

The annual Big 3 lot beat the annual SPY lot long-term 19 out of 25 years. This is very heavily indebted to Microsoft offsetting many years of Exxon and GE being top 3 companies which are now in major decline. On the individual stock side, it wasn't nearly as lopsided: 38 of 75 batches beat $1000 worth of SPY purchased on the same day, 37 did not. As we slip into the past decade, that number drops drastically, with 25 batches outperforming the market and 8 underperforming it.

Microsoft (21 years), Apple (11 years) Amazon (2 years) and Google (3 years) beat the matching SPY lot every single year it made the list.

Exxon (19 years), GE (13 years), Cisco (1 year), Chevron (1 year), Wal-mart (1 year) and Coca-Cola (1 year) lost to the SPY lot every single year they made the list.

Berkshire split, with one year beating the market and one year losing to it.

They are BEYOND hurting for revenue if they're opening back up banned AdSense accounts.

This could be a short-term boon to their revenues, but *definitely* poses a long-term danger to the rates Google can charge.

Class B shares are not publicly traded, they're held by insiders and have 10x voting power.

997,997,2020-05-02,"Trading Penny Stocks vs. Blue Chip Stocks Penny stocks get a bad reputation in the stock market, rightfully so, but that doesn't necessarily make them bad to trade. Most people actually start of trading penny stocks as opposed to what are known as *""blue chip stocks.""* Like anything else, there are pros and cons to each. I wanted to share this post to talk about some of the misconceptions of penny stocks, and explain why I personally focus on them with my own day trading.

First, **what even is a penny stock?** No... penny stocks are not just stocks worth a single penny and no they're not just stocks worth less than $1.00. By definition, any stock priced below $5.00 per share is considered a penny stock.

Penny stocks are priced low for a reason. They're *usually* the stock of a lesser-know company with not-so-reliable reputation to their shareholders. That's why they have such a bad reputation in general, and is why a lot of people think trading penny stocks is pure gambling. At the end of the day, penny stocks offer day traders a lot more than most blue chip stocks offer.

A **blue chip stock** is the stock of a huge company with a great reputation. These are stocks like Apple ($AAPL), Amazon ($AMZN), Google ($GOOG), Facebook ($FB), etc... basically ""household name"" companies. Although these seem like the better investment options, they're not necessarily going to be the better option for an average trader.

**Penny Stock Pros:**

**Higher Volatility:** Penny stocks generally have much higher volatility than blue chip stocks, making them more high risk, high reward. A certain amount of volatility is needed for day trading! Without it there is not enough price movement to be able to get in and out of positions within the day like day traders do. The high volatility in the penny stock market is the reason traders are able to make 10%, 20%, even 50% or more in a single day... a *very* rare occurrence in the blue chip market.

**Less Money Needed:** With penny stocks you may be able to buy 1,000s of shares at a time with a small account when you'd only be able to buy a few shares of a blue chip stock. Because of the extra volatility in the penny stock market, your 1,000 share penny stock investment has potential for a greater return than your 1,000 share blue chip investment... even though you’d be investing far more capital into the blue chip stock. With that being said, penny stocks are usually looked at as the much better option for new traders with limited capital to start trading. In fact, that why most new traders do end up starting with penny stocks, which leads me to the third ""pro.""

**Less ""Competition"":** Your competition in the stock market is every single other buyer and seller. Everyone is competing against each other to get the best prices and to buy low and sell high for a profit. When one person loses money, another gains! *So..*. would you rather be competing against multi-billion dollar funds and investment firms in the blue chip market, or a herd on new traders with little-to-no experience in the penny stock market? Now that's not to say there aren't still investment firms and algorithmic trading taking place in the penny stock market, but it is less common than it is in the blue chip market.

**Penny Stock Cons:**

**Higher Volatility:** A double-edged sword. As I already mentioned above, the higher volatility of the penny stock market can definitely be a big benefit, but if you're not careful it can also cause larger losses than you would experience with less volatility. This is why risk management and proper position sizing is crucial, especially when trading stocks with high volatility.

**Less Volume:** This is one of the concerns that most traders bring up when they talk about why they don't trade penny stocks. In my opinion, this doesn't make much sense as a ""con"" just for penny stocks, because there are plenty blue chip stocks with low liquidity and volume as well. As day traders, we have to adapt to the market on a daily basis. This means finding the stocks making larger-than-average moves with high relative volume and, usually, news or a press release to go along. Volume is only an issue with day trading penny stocks if you're choosing the wrong penny stocks to day trade.

**Low-Quality Companies:** Again, penny stocks are priced low for a reason. If they were multi-billion dollar companies with years of growing profitability, their stock price would reflect that. It's important to trade the stock, don't fall in love with it! You don't want to invest in a penny stock long-term, because the odds of you picking the next Amazon of Apple are slim to none. Instead, take advantage of the increase volatility brought by the penny stock market for day trading and look to the more reliable blue chip market for your swing trades longer-term investments.

As you can see, there are definitely some pros and cons to consider before diving into the penny stock market to start day trading. If you have the discipline to manage risk properly then they can be a great option to grow a small trading account in a short period of time. *Otherwise,* you may want to take things a bit more slowly by focussing your trading on less volatile, more stable blue chip stocks.",GOOG,trading penny stock v blue chip stock penny stock get bad reputation stock market rightfully doesnt necessarily make bad trade people actually start trading penny stock opposed known blue chip stock like anything else pro con wanted share post talk misconception penny stock explain personally focus day trading first even penny stock penny stock stock worth single penny theyre stock worth le 100 definition stock priced 500 per share considered penny stock penny stock priced low reason theyre usually stock lesserknow company notsoreliable reputation shareholder thats bad reputation general lot people think trading penny stock pure gambling end day penny stock offer day trader lot blue chip stock offer blue chip stock stock huge company great reputation stock like apple aapl amazon amzn google goog facebook fb etc basically household name company although seem like better investment option theyre necessarily going better option average trader penny stock pro higher volatility penny stock generally much higher volatility blue chip stock making high risk high reward certain amount volatility needed day trading without enough price movement able get position within day like day trader high volatility penny stock market reason trader able make 10 20 even 50 single day rare occurrence blue chip market le money needed penny stock may able buy 1000 share time small account youd able buy share blue chip stock extra volatility penny stock market 1000 share penny stock investment potential greater return 1000 share blue chip investment even though ’ investing far capital blue chip stock said penny stock usually looked much better option new trader limited capital start trading fact new trader end starting penny stock lead third pro le competition competition stock market every single buyer seller everyone competing get best price buy low sell high profit one person loses money another gain would rather competing multibillion dollar fund investment firm blue chip market herd new trader littletono experience penny stock market thats say arent still investment firm algorithmic trading taking place penny stock market le common blue chip market penny stock con higher volatility doubleedged sword already mentioned higher volatility penny stock market definitely big benefit youre careful also cause larger loss would experience le volatility risk management proper position sizing crucial especially trading stock high volatility le volume one concern trader bring talk dont trade penny stock opinion doesnt make much sense con penny stock plenty blue chip stock low liquidity volume well day trader adapt market daily basis mean finding stock making largerthanaverage move high relative volume usually news press release go along volume issue day trading penny stock youre choosing wrong penny stock day trade lowquality company penny stock priced low reason multibillion dollar company year growing profitability stock price would reflect important trade stock dont fall love dont want invest penny stock longterm odds picking next amazon apple slim none instead take advantage increase volatility brought penny stock market day trading look reliable blue chip market swing trade longerterm investment see definitely pro con consider diving penny stock market start day trading discipline manage risk properly great option grow small trading account short period time otherwise may want take thing bit slowly focussing trading le volatile stable blue chip stock,Positive,0.9953
998,998,2020-05-05,"Warren Buffett and the Stock Market Crash Warren Buffett made headlines recently after his recent [virtual Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders Meeting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69rm13iUUgE).

Buffett sold of all his shares in the major US airlines, and Berkshire announced a record quarterly net loss of nearly $50BN. Berkshire *had* held sizeable positions (around 10%) in the major US airlines.

As well as this, Buffett also allowed Berkshire's cash stake to rise to a record $137.3BN from $128BN at the end of 2019.

Clearly, as he is selling at a significant loss, Buffett believes that there is further pain ahead for the airlines. 

The GOAT is not one to fall for the sunk cost fallacy...

Moreover, his cash position indicates that he doesn't believe that we have reached the stock market bottom yet, although he wouldn't give specifics.

Others however are more explicitly bearish.

The numbers are certainly [not looking good](https://fortune.com/2020/03/20/recession-us-gdp-negative-growth-q2-predictions/)...

The economy was going to crash anyway. It was inevitable.

However, they were afraid of massive protests against corporate greed, massive social unrest, etc so they needed a diversion that would provide an excuse.

People will think the crash was solely due to the virus and not the numerous fundamental economic and structural issues at play.

To highlight just a few: we've had the [yield curve inversion](https://www.businessinsider.de/international/yield-curve-inversion-explained-what-it-is-what-it-means-2019-8/?r=US&IR=T), the [repo madness](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-12-08/repo-blowup-was-fueled-by-big-banks-and-hedge-funds-bis-says), the [record corporate debt](https://www.businessinsider.de/international/us-corporate-debt-10-trillion-record-percentage-economy-expert-warnings-2019-12/?r=US&IR=T), and [corporations being the main source of demand for equities via stock buybacks](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/25/business/stock-market-buybacks.html) which enrich executives that hit certain earnings per share targets.

Last year billionaire Peter Thiel, who was part of the notorious Paypal Mafia, [spoke on the dangers of American Exceptionalism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JRyy2MM-rI). He argues that this has made America ""exceptionally un-self-critical""

Warren Buffett concluded in his virtual meeting: ""Never bet against America""

In other words, never bet against the military industrial complex to enforce American superiority and the power of the dollar as the de facto unit of exchange globally.

**TRUTH 2/2:**

As smart contracts pioneer Nick Szabo has stated:

""Buffett's wealth can be measured less in present cash than in the future cash from the Fed he is right up there at the front of the Cantillon line to get.""

[The Cantillon Effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv5xl1AEeQs) essentially refers to the fact that fiat printing itself increases inequality. 

On a more general note, it is important to remember that, despite his gentle image, Buffett is ruthless in his craft. 

A [New York magazine profile from 1991](https://books.google.de/books?id=veTPZA9TWxsC&pg=PA45&lpg=PA45&dq=1991+new+york+magazine+warren+buffett+Warren+looks+like+a+teddy+bear,+but+mentally+is+he+ever+tough&source=bl&ots=OT8xAOp_-y&sig=ACfU3U2s1_9PvAvkaw4w5BSh0l1KgG1yhA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjtvP2__ZzpAhUG3aQKHfcYA1kQ6AEwFXoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=1991%20new%20york%20magazine%20warren%20buffett%20Warren%20looks%20like%20a%20teddy%20bear%2C%20but%20mentally%20is%20he%20ever%20tough&f=false) stated: 

""Though he appears homey and guileless and cultivates a hayseed image, Buffett can be iron-fisted.""

According to a senior Salomon trader: ""Warren looks like a teddy bear, but mentally is he ever tough.""

Yes, Buffett has dropped numerous gems throughout the years, but ultimately his responsibility is to Berkshire Hathaway and his own, sizeable, bags.

Overall, it would be foolish to overlook Buffett's current cash position.

When everything is dirt cheap and we do eventually hit the bottom, he will be flush with cash and ready to aggressively sweep up bargains. 

At the moment, it is clear that he believes these bargains are not present, and therefore it would be wise to consider the fact that we may have further downside in store...

Warren Buffett concluded in his virtual meeting: ""Never bet against America""

In other words, never bet against the military industrial complex to enforce American superiority and the power of the dollar as the de facto unit of exchange globally.

&#x200B;

**TRUTH 2/2:**

As smart contracts pioneer Nick Szabo has stated:

""Buffett's wealth can be measured less in present cash than in the future cash from the Fed he is right up there at the front of the Cantillon line to get.""

[The Cantillon Effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv5xl1AEeQs) essentially refers to the fact that fiat printing itself increases inequality. 

On a more general note, it is important to remember that, despite his gentle image, Buffett is ruthless in his craft. 

A [New York magazine profile from 1991](https://books.google.de/books?id=veTPZA9TWxsC&pg=PA45&lpg=PA45&dq=1991+new+york+magazine+warren+buffett+Warren+looks+like+a+teddy+bear,+but+mentally+is+he+ever+tough&source=bl&ots=OT8xAOp_-y&sig=ACfU3U2s1_9PvAvkaw4w5BSh0l1KgG1yhA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjtvP2__ZzpAhUG3aQKHfcYA1kQ6AEwFXoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=1991%20new%20york%20magazine%20warren%20buffett%20Warren%20looks%20like%20a%20teddy%20bear%2C%20but%20mentally%20is%20he%20ever%20tough&f=false) stated: 

""Though he appears homey and guileless and cultivates a hayseed image, Buffett can be iron-fisted.""

According to a senior Salomon trader: ""Warren looks like a teddy bear, but mentally is he ever tough.""

Yes, Buffett has dropped numerous gems throughout the years, but ultimately his responsibility is to Berkshire Hathaway and his own, sizeable, bags.

Overall, it would be foolish to overlook Buffett's current cash position.

When everything is dirt cheap and we do eventually hit the bottom, he will be flush with cash and ready to aggressively sweep up bargains. 

At the moment, it is clear that he believes these bargains are not present, and therefore it would be wise to consider the fact that we may have further downside in store...

Futures turnings green now. Tomorrow markets likely skyrocketing ... Buy In May, And Never Go Away.

Happiness is BUY BUY BUY?

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

Dow Jones futures edged higher late Tuesday, along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures, as **Walt Disney** ([**DIS**](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)), **Beyond Meat** ([**BYND**](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BYND)) and **MercadoLibre** ([**MELI**](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MELI)) were among the many earnings reports overnight after the coronavirus stock market rally continued to advance.

Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to Stock Market Today.

**Microsoft** ([**MSFT**](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **Shopify** ([**SHOP**](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)), **PayPal** ([**PYPL**](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)), **ServiceNow** ([**NOW**](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)), **Adobe** ([**ADBE**](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) and **Chegg** ([**CHGG**](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHGG)) cleared buy points Tuesday, even as the Dow Jones and other major indexes slashed gains in the final hour.

MercadoLibre stock looks set to join them, blasting higher overnight. Beyond Meat stock rose but is well off highs. Disney stock woes continued overnight.

Adobe stock, ServiceNow stock, Chegg stock and Microsoft stock are all on **IBD Leaderboard**. All four boast perfect 99 **IBD Composite Ratings**. PayPal stock has a stellar 97 Composite Rating. Shopify stock has a 96 Composite Rating, while MercadoLibre stock has an OK 80 CR.

SHOP stock and PYPL stock broke out ahead of quarterly reports Wednesday, with Shopify earnings before the open. Microsoft stock had multiple entries, while Adobe stock moved back into a buy zone. ServiceNow stock cleared a buy point after surging last week on earnings. Chegg stock gapped higher on earnings.

Adobe and ServiceNow teamed up on customer service software, giving a lift to ADBE stock and NOW stock

MSFT stock is on **SwingTrader**. Adobe stock, ServiceNow stock and Chegg stock are on the **IBD 50 list**.

Microsoft stock, ServiceNow stock and Adobe stock are on **IBD Long-Term Leaders** list. PayPal stock is on the Long-Term Leaders watchlist.

## Dow Jones Futures Today

Dow Jones futures were slightly above fair value, with Disney stock a modest drag. S&P 500 futures edged higher. Nasdaq 100 futures rose 0.3%. No longer surging limit up or down, Dow Jones futures can still be volatile in overnight trading.

Remember that overnight action in **Dow futures**, MercadoLibre and elsewhere doesn't necessarily translate into actual trading in the next regular **stock market** session.

But holding a stock that doesn't pay dividents earns you no money. This is where Tesla comes in.

In 2019 investors pulled their money out of the stock market en masse in reaction to the yield curve inverting and the high interest rates that caused the market to dip in Sep, 2018.

They never put it back in, rather stock buy-backs fueled the 2019 and 2020 rally.

**Edit:** From the Business Insider article: 

""One reason for this is that investor selling has been ""swamped"" by corporate buying, Fraser-Jenkins said. Global corporates have announced $820 billion in buybacks this year, which has exceeded selling by traditional investors. That's been supportive to the market as a whole, since when companies reduce their outstanding share count by repurchasing units, it lifts the per-share value of the remaining stock. In addition, companies have $1.3 trillion in pending mergers and acquisitions, which he says also supports the equity market. ""

**Edit:** Since people are questioning the source... On the March 9, 2020 Bloomberg odd lots podcast Vincent Deluard, the Director of Global Macro for INTL FCStone Inc. Said:

""Most investors have already pulled their money out of equities in response to what they saw happing in the bond market in 2018 and 2019.""

AAPL has recovered incredibly quickly and was briefly back at all time high yesterday ($320). Going forward, if more bad than good news come, it has a long way to fall (it hit $224 on March 23). If more good than bad news come, realistically it only has a minor potential climb in the near future. 

LUV is probably somewhere close to bottom. It’s been falling steadily for the past month but similar, slightly riskier stocks like DAL have been relatively flat for a while now and LUV will be too as it finds its way to the bottom.

“Our cautiousness around Netflix is around a number of things. Number one, cash flow for the company has been negative for a number of years and looks to be negative going forward as well. The cash burn is very high. Number two, and you are seeing this in the U.S., competition is expanding heavily here. Disney Plus has hit over 50 million subscribers, next month is the launch of HBO Max, Peacock, Hulu is picking up subscribers,” argued Macker on Yahoo Finance’s The First Trade. Macker adds that he is concerned about Netflix’s ability to raise prices further and increasing competition overseas, notably in the important market of India.

The analyst sees Netflix’s fair value at $160, or 62% below its current trading price.

1021,1021,2020-05-22,"Joe Rogan's $100 Million Spotify Deal Joe ""podcast is moving to Spotify"" Rogan made [headlines recently when he announced that he has signed an exclusive deal with Spotify](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/20/business/media/joe-rogan-spotify-contract.html).

The multi-year deal is reportedly worth more than $100 million.

Within just 48 hours of the announcement, [Spotify's market cap increased by nearly $4 billion](https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/spotifys-market-cap-value-soars-by-nearly-4bn-in-wake-of-landmark-joe-rogan-podcast-deal/), to it's highest point in nearly two years.

At the time of the announcement, Spotify's share price was around $169, with a market cap around $31BN. As of yesterday, their share price hit an all time high of over $195, with a market cap around $36BN.

Clearly, this is a big coup for Spotify, who have nabbed the biggest name in the podcast world and one of the biggest stars on YouTube.

His podcast is the number one podcast in the world and gets as many as 190 million downloads per month. In fact, he was [Forbes highest-paid podcaster of 2019, raking in $30 million](https://www.forbes.com/sites/arielshapiro/2020/02/03/crime-does-pay-my-favorite-murder-stars-join-joe-rogan-as-highest-earning-podcasters/#177986913773).

Of course, this had led to a discussion about the value of content, specifically the value assigned to music and longer form content like Rogan's podcast.

According to music writer [Ted Gioia, a musician would need to generate 23 billion streams on Spotify to earn what they're paying Joe Rogan for his podcast rights](https://twitter.com/tedgioia/status/1262930316253110276).

It is important to understand the context here:

**For every dollar in revenue the Spotify earns, it sends 65 cents straight to the record industry.**

**This caps Spotify's earnings potential, and means that it has a less robust business model than Netflix.**

**For example, if Netflix pays, say, $30 million to make a new season of Ozark, that cost doesn't increase if it attracts more eyeballs. Media Rights Capital, which produces the show, makes the same money from Netflix regardless of whether the audience is 5,000 or 5 million.**

**However, that is not the case with Spotify: costs** ***rise*** **with subscribers.**

**Every stream will see another slice of the listener's monthly subscription fee go to the record label.**

Spotify has a gross margin of around 25%, whereas Netflix has a gross margin of around 38%.

Spotify has recently spent more than $600 million acquiring four podcasting firms, [including the $250 million acquisition of Ringer earlier this year.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-11/spotify-said-to-pay-250-million-for-ringer-in-podcasting-drive)

Therefore, for a capped cost, Spotify can attract new listeners and potential subscribers. Also, the more time listeners spend on podcasts, the less money Spotify gives to the record labels.

[The deal has raised comparisons with Howard Stern](https://www.forbes.com/sites/arielshapiro/2020/05/19/the-new-howard-stern-podcast-giant-joe-rogan-inks-exclusive-deal-with-spotify/) and SiriusXM, which has made Stern a fortune.

[In 2019 alone, Stern took home an estimated $93 million.](https://www.forbes.com/profile/howard-stern/#5bedd7033dc7)

If video killed the radio star, did Spotify just kill the YouTube star?

Or is this a smart move on Rogan's part?

After all, it is expected that some clips will remain on YouTube for the casual algorithm viewers.

Rogan has previously been [critical of YouTube's demonetisation policy and censorship on the platform](https://reclaimthenet.org/joe-rogan-youtube-demonetization-policies/).

Overall, Rogan is banking a guaranteed $100 million in an [uncertain economic environment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsAfJMNtxsU).

Although some have commented that he is sacrificing the scale provided by YouTube, he may well still have his clips channel on YouTube.

As well as this, he is *licensing* his podcast.

Therefore, if it fails, he has pocketed $100 million and can return to other platforms, thus generating more press.

If it succeeds, he has pocketed $100 million and will have more leverage in the next contract negotiations.

Now that's a win-win.

What are your thoughts on the move?

1023,1023,2020-05-24,"Storytime: The time I bought Netflix (NFLX) So a long, long, time ago in a market far, far, away. I was a young and decently paid new investor with no knowledge of investing but knew I want to get into the game. So I said NFLX would be the starting stock point.

The year, late 2015 (November). I had a Netflix account for some years now, my family and friends all had Netflix accounts, and I started thinking, ”hmmm...maybe, I should buy some stock in NFLX?” 

Now, as a new investor, if I saw a stock over $50, I wasn't buying because, in my eyes, I’d already missed the boat (I don't think like this now). NTFX was trading around $100-$125 at the time wayyyy to rich for my blood, but I had a feeling that it was going to continue to go up. 

So I opened a Scottrade account, watched some YouTube videos on how to buy stocks, and told myself, ”Self: If NFLX drops below $100, I'll invest $5000.” So I watched the market like a hawk for the next few months waiting on my opportunity.

My time... Or what I thought was my time:

February 7, 2016, I was watching television and saw that NFLX had some ”bad press” which was they were raising their price for $5.99 to 6 or $7.99 a month, and investors thought it was a bad idea, so they started selling. The price went from $125 to $82 at the lowest.

Now I'm jumping with joy because it dropped below the $100 mark and I was going to buy $5000 worth... well, that was the plan anyway. When I logged on to my account, I only bought $1000 worth or 11 shares for a total of $951. I was too afraid to buy the 5k worth because I wanted to have the money in my account. So instead of having 50+ shares at a fantastic price, I ended up with 11 because I was too scared and cheap.

I still own those 11 shares of NFLX and have made 4k in profit. I still kick myself for not buying more when I had the chance. I could be sitting on 20k plus in profit in four years right now. 

The moral of this story is to trust your gut! I've had that feeling on a few more stocks since then and put the money in and now reaping the rewards MTCH, OKTA, and TSLA. Don't be like me and wonder what if?! I live by ”Buy once; cry once.”  you can't take the money with you when you die, so buy and hold and watch it grow.

1026,1026,2020-05-25,"The Case About Tech Stocks **TL;DR:** I believe there is a possibility of tech stocks being battered by the crisis that is not being taken into account by the markets.

I've been following the market more closely since the coronavirus crisis began. Like some people here, the current bull market / bear market rally has been puzzling me because of the state of the economy and of how long this is going to last. It has been said time and again that the market is not the economy, and that is true, as the market is, among other things, a gauge of investor sentiment. And the sentiment for tech stocks it's as high as it's been.

At the time of writing, NASDAQ is up 4% for the year. From my understanding, this is due to the confidence in the biotech sector and, of course, tech stocks. Focusing on tech stocks in general, it looks like people are betting on huge gains on those. And I think there's a point in that tech will benefit from this in a way. But I'm bearish about it, and here's why:

* **Ad revenue:** some of the biggest players heavily rely on ad revenue for profiting. It's understood that many businesses will cut on advertising. Google has said that it will affect their bottom line, expect Facebook to follow suit
* **Consumer spending:** because of the current situation, I expect smartphone sales to take a hit. For many companies (e.g. Apple) this is a main stream of revenue and, although I expect to see a consumption increase in laptop, tablet, and other accessories (e.g. webcams, headsets) I don't see the latter offsetting losses in the former
* **Mobility:** decreased usage of mobility services (e.g. Uber, Lyft, car-sharing apps), if even because of less tourists and air traffic
* **Travel:** even if travel goes back up a bit, it won't go back to 2019 levels (e.g. Airbnb, Booking)
* **Work-From-Home:** here I do believe that tech companies will come out on top, but I'm cautious about it because many companies had already purchased the tools for this (therefore not resulting in a significantly larger pool of customers)
* **Earnings:** a lot of companies removed guidance for the current quarter, which makes it a lot harder to know what to expect (not really bearish, but a factor to keep in mind)
* **Retail investors:** there has been a surge of retail investors entering the market after the crash. These people are likely to bet in “hot” stocks, not the least tech stocks (and biotech and pharmaceuticals). This has undoubtedly been one of the major factors driving the market upwards in my opinion, and might be a red flag if or when the market gets dire
* **Stimulus:** this is what I'm most unsure about. From what I read, the FED has a huge bond-purchasing programme. With this, the FED wants to keep confidence in the markets. My question is, because of the huge debt that the FED already has, and to how large the bond market is ($80 trillion) in comparison with the FED programmes, how much difference will it make?

1029,1029,2020-05-26,"‘Stay at home’ tech stocks fall as some pandemic lockdowns end Stocks that seemed resilient to the Covid-19 pandemic faced pressure Tuesday, as investors rallied around a potential coronavirus vaccine and reopening of the economy. 

Shares of Netflix, Shopify, Peloton and Zoom, all companies that once benefited from consumers sheltering in place across the country, closed lower Tuesday. The moves come despite a strong day for the broader markets, which have seen steep lows due to the pandemic. 

Netflix stock, which hit a 52-week high last week, closed down 3.4%. E-commerce platform Shopify, which supplies businesses with means to sell products online, dropped nearly 7% after reaching a 52-week high Tuesday. Shares of Peloton, a digital fitness company, dropped nearly 9%. Zoom, the videoconferencing software company that drew massive users, dropped more than 4%.

Roughly four months after hitting an all-time high just before financial markets and economies faltered in the face of the current public health crisis, Apple's stock price has returned to those levels and has set a new all-time high today.


Apple's previous intraday high of $327.85 was set on January 29, and that high-water mark was surpassed just a few minutes ago as it hit $328.00 before pulling back slightly. Apple's share price had fallen as low as $212.61 on March 23 before beginning a fairly steady march back up. The company's all-time closing high is $327.20, set on February 12.

Apple is up over $4.00 today amid broader market gains as U.S. employment numbers for the month of May released today came in with an unexpected increase.

I know these are not likely worth anything, but I’m genuinely curious. From what I can tell in my quick internet searching, the company no longer exists in the same structure of the time of the share purchase (acquisition possibly). 

I’ve found a couple sites that you can pay ~$50 for experts to do some deep research and track down their current worth. Anyone have experience doing their own research on older paper stocks or recommendations for a good service?

***Edit 1 to add company info. 

The company is Plough Inc, which looks to have eventually merged under Merck. I’ve reached out to Merck’s Transfer Agent (based on rec’s from google). Will update here as I make progress.

***Edit 2 
I appreciate all the interest! No definite answers yet, but hoping to hear back from a Merck rep in the next few days. 

As of now, here are my thoughts from my digging and combined effort of the powers of reddit: 
- My certificate states exactly 2 shares purchased in 1948 for Plough Inc. between all of the mergers and share splits, I could be up to 5 shares of current Merck value (~$83/share)
- Theres a high possibility I will run into a barrier with the certificate being in my great-grandfathers name. This will likely cause major issues on trying to claim dividends lost to unclaimed property. I also have no clue how long dividends were collected originally.

And for the full second quarter, the S&P 500 has surged 17%, making this the best three-month performance for the stock market since the fourth quarter of 1998.

[Bankrupt stocks](http://www.cnn.com/2020/06/11/investing/bankrupt-stocks-surge/index.html) have inexplicably soared as of late. So have [IPOs](http://www.cnn.com/2020/06/09/investing/vroom-ipo/index.html) and [blank check special purpose acquisition companies](http://www.cnn.com/2020/06/01/investing/virgin-galactic-stock-spacex/index.html) like Virgin Galactic ([SPCE](https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=SPCE&source=story_quote_link)), [DraftKings](https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=DKNG) and electric truck maker [Nikola](https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=NKLA).But stimulus from the Federal Reserve isn't going away anytime soon. The central bank will almost certainly keep rates at zero for years and it is pumping out trillions of dollars into the economy through various lending programs.""Don't fight the Fed"" is a popular saying on Wall Street. Is it really that simple? It just might be.""Markets are clearly responding to the significant stimulus in the US and throughout the world,"" said Kent Insley, chief investment officer with Tiedemann Advisors. Insley told CNN Business that the massive stimulus from the Fed as well as various programs from Congress should help the market for the foreseeable future. Cheap money will push investors into riskier stocks over Treasuries, which now yield next to nothing.📷[Biotech IPOs are booming -- but it's not all about Covid-19](https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/25/investing/biotech-ipos-stocks/index.html)""lt may be a low growth environment but rates are going to remain low. Stocks still look more attractive over the long term compared to bonds,"" Insley said.He added that investors should focus on companies with solid balance sheets that can continue to post decent growth rates. And he said that investors don't have to limit themselves to big tech stocks -- the so-called [FAANGs](http://www.cnn.com/2020/06/09/investing/nasdaq-record-10000/index.html) and Microsoft ([MSFT](https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=MSFT&source=story_quote_link)).

### Betting on an eventual rebound

Others are also dismissing concerns about weak profits.""In the grand scheme of things, one year of earnings are not that meaningful for the valuation of a company unless there is a major liquidity issue,"" said Sam Hendel, president of Levin Easterly Partners.Hendel said he is worried about heavily indebted energy firms and struggling travel and leisure companies. But he added that firms in other parts of the market, most notably tech, consumer staples and health care, have the ""ballast to withstand an economic contraction.""He favors companies like broadband and media giant Comcast ([CMCSA](https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=CMCSA&source=story_quote_link)), packaged food and beverage firms Treehouse ([THS](https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=THS&source=story_quote_link)), Post Holdings ([POST](https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=POST&source=story_quote_link)) and Primo Water ([PRMW](https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=PRMW&source=story_quote_link)) and health care companies Pfizer ([PFE](https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=PFE&source=story_quote_link)) and Quest Diagnostics ([DGX](https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=DGX&source=story_quote_link)).Hendel also thinks it's reasonable to think that a major biotech or pharma company will come up with a viable coronavirus treatment sooner rather than later. That could further boost health care stocks.""We're not trying to call the bottom on Covid-19, but we hope and pray for a vaccine coming as well,"" he said. ""What 9/11 was for the defense sector, Covid-19 is for health care.""More broadly, there are still hopes that stocks won't fall back into a bear market.Merger activity is slowly starting to pick up as companies grow a little more confident that the Fed and Congress will continue to be there as a backstop to keep the economy from sliding further.Ted Swimmer, head of capital markets with Citizens Bank, said that over the past two months, his firm has been positively surprised by the number of companies issuing new capital and talking about plans to grow again.""The government is providing so much support, so I'd be surprised if the market touches the March lows again,"" he said.",MSFT,expect wall street stock market firework next month here

Microsoft:
One of the biggest companies in the world and an ever innovative giant of the tech industry. They have their hands in so many different sectors that are projected to keep growing massively this decade and they are one of the safest plays you can make in my opinion.

Mastercard:
Fintech will only ever keep growing, barring a huge swing in prevailing sentiment, and Mastercard is the smaller although more innovative one of what is essentially a duopoly with Visa, who are the biggest player in the sector. With around 77% of all transactions worldwide still conducted with physical cash, I expect plenty of growth from them in the future.

Cameco:
I am a big believer in uranium and the role it plays in nuclear power. In my opinion and also the opinion of a plethora of environmental scientists, politicians and industry insiders, the price for uranium needs to go up and nuclear power needs to become a significant part of the fight against climate change.

Full of debt and in a cut throat industry where margins are slim and competition is fierce. Tesla is being priced like it will take over the world, that 1/2 cars in the world will be a Tesla. Have people forgotten that Ford, GM, Audi and BMW are all making electric cars now? Have people forgotten the self driving technology being developed by Waymo? Have people forgotten the bottomless pit companies like Microsoft have to dominate in AI and self driving?

There is virtually zero moat with what Tesla does, once the germans ramp up full self driving electric cars, where will Tesla go?

As valuations rise, a company has to deliver more and more to justify its price. Eventually it gets to a point where it can't. I want to stress that most great companies were profitable at IPO, Google was profitable, so was Facebook. Companies which don't make money but live on a fairy tale story always end in tears.

For sure there is a future for Tesla, as electric cars become mainstream, but being priced to take over the car industry is a joke and will not happen. There are many people who drive an Audi and will not drive anything else. Software wise I don't see Tesla having any major lead over Big Tech, Microsoft and Audi can very much work together on a self driving electric car.

I know Tesla is a cult and has loyal fans, but you can't compare it to Apple. Apple produce a great product (the iphone) with a massive moat (the apple ecosystem) around it, Tesla doesn't have a moat.

* MS Teams performance is going to be a big deal, as it's [bundled with Office 365](https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-teams-now-microsoft-reveals-when-you-can-expect-to-see-49-people-on-screen/) and fully integrated-- mid and large cap companies looking to strengthen work from home muscles would go with this since they likely already pay for it and trust boring MSFT over haute slack, etc.

* [Azure is a growth market](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2020/07/06/how-microsoft-created-800-billion-in-3-years--can-it-repeat/#1fa6e54c7dd1) during all this, plenty of room for cloud growth in lots of sectors, including government and education, where MSFT holds many, many long-term or no limit contracts

* Last earnings call MSFT said they [saw ""minimal"" impact](https://www.barrons.com/articles/microsoft-stock-rises-after-company-says-covid-19-had-minimal-impact-on-fiscal-third-quarter-earnings-51588193445) due to COVID--and as far as I can tell this is a company basically custom built for a stay-at-home pandemic

* Xbox is a big deal, and the Gamepass streaming tech is getting a major invest, already way [outperforming Sony 5x](https://www.businessinsider.com/xbox-game-pass-is-much-bigger-than-playstation-now-2020-5) with many tier 1 titles and early access, etc., also the FB partnership is important for growth

* Salesforce brought the CRM battle home to Seattle with the purchase of Tableau, and MSFT has been [steadily facelifting](https://msdynamicsworld.com/story/microsoft-launches-preview-dynamics-365-project-operations-how-we-got-here) Dynamics, which it sells to enterprise and gov't customers for a huge premium, sometimes bundling with Power BI

* And the company still puts [emphasis on B2C](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2020/07/01/introducing-new-onedrive-features-to-share-and-collaborate-across-work-and-life/), because you can still buy individual ""ownership"" licenses of products like Windows and Office, instead of SaaS only, demonstrating market flexibility to maximize profits

* Moat only getting dug deeper through lots of [cross-platform integration](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/microsoft-teams-and-skype-users-can-now-chat-together/) and product bundling (e.g. I can now see *all* my software including xbox from one account)

* Also, I like that MSFT takes 2-4 year risks, and then gets out if it doesn't go well--they're [closing the retail stores](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/techburger/article/R-I-P-Microsoft-Stores-We-hardly-knew-ye-And-15377633.php) they'd opened, which I think is smart baking

The image of MSFT is improving--a lot of the toxic culture stuff has been going away since the invention of Nutella and the stock has been rising steadily now that the market has taken notice. They're able to attract more talent, and they have restructured their leadership.

My positions: MSFT 220c 7/17, MSFT 215c 9/18. I'll admit I also want to buy stock. I'm that retarded for this toasty loaf. Gonna go eat some bread now.

p.s. ebay is a shithole company and it should die a torturous, mutilated death

1074,1074,2020-07-06,"$AAPL - iOS14 changes could cut app ad monetization by 50% When Apple rolls out iOS14 (likely in September), any app/developer who wants access to the Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA) for an Apple device will need to get user consent again. (IDFA is currently used by advertisers to track users across apps/websites).

That consent is stored and only reset if user uninstall/reinstall the app, so the app can't just keep prompting for user for consent over and over. Also, AAPL will control the language/presentation of the consent prompt, although developers should still have some options around how to minimize opt-outs (e.g. degrading app experience until user accepts tracking).

According to a research report by D. A. Davidson, this change is not completely unexpected. A poll by Ad Profs (an independent ad tech consultancy) in Sep 2019 suggests \~80% of those surveyed had expected some major change to IDFA within a year. They estimate 1/2 of iOS users will upgrade to iOS14 within a few weeks of rollout, and above 90% of users will have upgraded by Q1 of 2021.

Ad Profs also estimate the iOS14 upgrade will result in \~50% cut to app ad monetization. They believe AAPL is secretly pushing App developers to encourage users who opt-out to pay for the app via in-app purchases because AAPL gets a 30% cut from those payments.",AAPL,aapl ios14 change could cut app ad monetization 50 apple roll ios14 likely september appdeveloper want access identifier advertiser idfa apple device need get user consent idfa currently used advertiser track user across appswebsites consent stored reset user uninstallreinstall app app cant keep prompting user consent also aapl control languagepresentation consent prompt although developer still option around minimize optouts eg degrading app experience user accepts tracking according research report davidson change completely unexpected poll ad prof independent ad tech consultancy sep 2019 suggests 80 surveyed expected major change idfa within year estimate 12 io user upgrade ios14 within week rollout 90 user upgraded q1 2021 ad prof also estimate ios14 upgrade result 50 cut app ad monetization believe aapl secretly pushing app developer encourage user optout pay app via inapp purchase aapl get 30 cut payment,Positive,0.1779
1075,1075,2020-07-07,"Am I too late to buy Tesla stock now? I've been having Tesla stuck in my head for a while now and those last 5 days have been amazing for Tesla shareholders (congrats!) where the stock increased up to 40% which I have never seen before

I've always monitored Tesla from the sideline and always wanted to become a shareholder, but I prioritised my stock wishlist  in an order where Tesla is not up yet (I only started investing in the US stock market 2 months ago)

I used Etoro as a tool to give me all the vital info about the stock I'm interested in, and according to the app, it predicts a downturn up to 40% (825$ per share) a year from now, and they imply that the overall consensus is Hold (buy 28%, hold 40% and sell 32%). I know that it's only a prediction and it's impossible to predict what will happen in the future, but since the stock price has skyrocketed up to a intriguing height by a month's span, it's become quite tricky to know where to enter as a Tesla shareholder now so I'd like to hear from you guys what you'd do if you were in my shoes

The majority of the Youtubers are very bullish on Tesla in the long term and I agree with what they say as they back it up with very legitimate facts, but my problem is that I have a tough time to decide if I should just buy and pretend that this increase never happened or if I should maybe wait for a few weeks and see if the share price comes ""down to reality"" since a 40% increase during 5 days is baffling

What do you guys think, I'd appreciate an in-depth insight from my fellow investors

I’ve been buying monthly calls on this thing since fuckin March, easiest money I’ve ever seen. Consistent, low stress tendies. 

Why is it creeping up like this? 

They’re business is fucking rock solid, diversified, and virus friendly. This thing was printing before the virus, and all aspects of msft are virus friendly.

Azure cloud is competing with AWS. 
As traditional businesses go remote, they trust Microsoft and pay for their comparatively shitty cloud.

“Shares of Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) rose 0.8% in premarket trading, which would put the on track to open in record territory, after Wedbush analyst Dan Ives raised his price target on the software and cloud giant, citing signs of ""relatively strong cloud deal activity"" during the June quarter. Ives reiterated the outperform rating he's had on the stock for at least the past 21 months but raised his target to $260 from $240, making him most bullish on Microsoft of the 35 analysts surveyed by FactSet. The second most bullish is Wells Fargo's Philip Winslow with a $250 price target, according to FactSet. ""In many cases we are seeing enterprises accelerate their digital transformation and cloud strategy with Microsoft by 6-to-12 months as the prospects of a heavy remote workforce for the foreseeable future now looks in the cards with this COVID-19 backdrop,"" Ives wrote in a note to clients. He believes Azure's cloud momentum is still in its ""early days"" of playing out.

During  this Pandemic they have been unbreakable and with 182+ million monthly subscribers at $9.99 minimum per month, those are outrageous passive revenue coming in automatically. It’s not like a product you buy once and that’s it, other companies have to deal with trying to sell as much as they can, but Netflix it sells automatically with their subscription business model which I love most during this pandemic. 

Subscription business model’s are the best way to go in my opinion during this time and even after the pandemic decreases, people will still have their subscriptions.

1088,1088,2020-07-12,"Sharing the 16 stocks in my portfolio Below I will be sharing my portfolio. I will add a short explanation under each company as to why I chose to add them. Any and all feedback and/or questions are greatly appreciated. The portfolio is as follows:

🖥Microsoft 12,5%
The biggest part of my portfolio, Microsoft is a safe play for a future where more and more things will be reliant on technology. They are growing their Azure cloud business every year and are looking to keep innovating to meet the different needs in the market. A giant blue chip and a safe investment in my opinion.

💳Mastercard 7,5% and 💳Visa 7,5%
Around 77% of all transactions worldwide are still done with cash and I think we will continue the transition to digital currency for the foreseeable future. MA and V have something of a duopoly on the fintech space and both own major payment networks that they are expanding all around the globe. The reason I picked both is that even though they tend preform similarly, you never know what might happen in the future that causes one of them to shoot away or drop down.


☢Cameco Corp 7,5%
I have posted a few things about my view on uranium and in short I believe that uranium miners and their respective shares will experience a 'parabolic' market shift and subsequent boost in their share prices within the next two years. Uranium makes up a total of 15% of my portfolio and I believe this play is less of an 'if' and more of a 'when', which is why it is a significant part.


✈Raytheon 7,5%
One of the biggest defence players in the sector. They are currently trading at a share price many view as undervalued, which can mostly be attributed to their exposure to the commercial flight industry. They have various sections and several big contracts with the government and I believe they are a safe play to get exposure to the defense market.


🖥Facebook 7,5%
Owners of some of the largest social media platforms in the world and sitting on a big pile of cash, Facebook is one of the biggest digital ad companies there is. They also diversify heavily into all sorts of things like AI, IOT, online shopping, VR and the goal to build something of a metaverse in the future. The only reason that they are not a bigger part of my portfolio is that they are prone to controversy, which does not help their share price.


🖥Nvidia 7,5%
Similarly to Facebook in the fact that they are well diversified (different types of chips for things like autonomous driving and advanced AI). They are a very innovative company under great leadership and if they can keep innovating like they have been doing, there will be plenty of growth ahead.


🖥Qualcomm 7,5%
The main play to take advantage of all the different applications 5G will have, Qualcomm is perhaps the biggest company in the 5G space with all sorts of great applications and patents in their arsenal. They are well positioned to take advantage as 5G gets adopted on a global scale form things like every day devices to even healthcare, which is why they are in my portfolio.


🖥Advanced Micro Devices 7,5%
Having experienced a massive growth of their company and share price in the past couple of years, they have become a big player in the chip sector under the leadership of their new CEO. With government contracts, innovative chips in new generation game consoles and other applications as well, they are taking market share off of Intel and are not looking to back down in the foreseeable future.


🖥OpenText 5%
A Canadian software and cloud company that is not mentioned a lot on here, they are doing all the right things to ride the wave of SAAS and the cloud. Their acquisition of US company Carbonite also gives them exposure to cloud document security, a service that will be demanded more and more. This is a slow and steady growth play in my portfolio.

💊Galapagos 5%
European biotech company Galapagos has been on a tear since the announcement that they would be partnering with US biotech giant Gilead. They currently have several much anticipated drugs in testing phases and if these are approved, expect this company and its share to grow exponentially.

🎮Activision 5%
I am a big believer in video games and their place in the entertainment market of the future, especially as graphics and VR keep improving and adding to the experience of video games. Activision is the biggest pure play video game company and owns some great franchises. They are also big in the mobile gaming market (especially after acquiring King digital), the fastest growing video gaming market in the world.

☢Energy Fuels Inc 5%
See the Cameco explanation. This is the biggest US uranium producer.

☢Denison Mines 2,5%
See the Cameco explanation. A relatively small miner with an amazing project in the works.

🚢Euronav Tankers 2,5%
Undervalued right now and poised to return to their previous heights as a shortage of tankers around the world is pushing prices up, any sign of significant economic recovery will help them as goods will be demanded more and more to help the economy get back on track.

⛏New Gold 2,5%
My play to have some exposure to the gold market, this company has several gold, silver and copper assets, but has not been treated as well by the rising gold tide as some of its gold mining peers.

1100,1100,2020-07-15,"Warren Buffet: ""If I had never sold a stock, I would be much wealthier"" See: https://youtu.be/MLgn_kVKjCE?t=1027

One of the biggest obstacles to active stock picking (as opposed to indexing) seems to be with all the problems with timing the market. We tend to want to buy when others want to buy, and less when others are fearful (i.e. the worst timing). 

But this strategy seems attractive. You pick high quality companies that you think will surge over the next 20 years (Amazon, Tesla, Disney, whatever you think) and NEVER SELL. 

This takes out some of the issues with active investing where people are getting in and out of the market at all the wrong times. 

What do you think? Would this solve any of the problems with active investing?

edit: lots of awesome comments but I think some people aren't being as charitable to the proposal as they should. Using examples of companies that rose and fall after 30 years isn't very fair to the main idea behind this proposal. Let's say buy and hold for 10 years minimum.

1102,1102,2020-07-15,"PTON V. NFLX: who should have a higher price-to-sales ratio? NFLX has been forced to focus expanding internationally since it is saturated in the United States – during their 2020 Q1 earnings, they reported that they had 70 million subscribers in the United States. I don’t think it’s unreasonable to assume that there are four users per account which would mean 280 million Americans have access to a Netflix account. Given that there are around 330 million Americans, there is not a ton of room for NFLX to grow in the United States. I am being generous when I say four people share a NFLX account – practically everyone I know has a family member or friend with a Netflix account which they piggy back off of. 

This account sharing cannot be done with a PTON bike. There is one Peloton bike and one Peloton subscription per household. Whereas one Netflix subscription can be in up to 10 households. Also, Peloton is not even close to being saturated in the United States with less than 1 million connected fitness subscribers in the U.S., and a total addressable market of 60 million Americans. Despite the fact PTON isn’t saturated in the U.S., they still have an aggressive sales plan to grow in Europe; which will later continue into Asia.  

NFLX’s production costs are probably outrageous compared to PTON. NFLX must pay A-list actors and third-party contractors for the content they distribute. Every time NFLX makes more money, third parties want a bigger piece of the pie. Whereas PTONs production is simple, easy and entirely in-house, which gives them total control of production costs. They have total control of their entire value chain from manufacturing, delivery, content production and customer service.

Yes, the hardware part makes it harder for PTON to acquire new customers but when someone buys a Peloton bike, they are paying 15 years’ worth of a Netflix subscription, right off the bat! Additionally, PTON’s subscription is 3x the cost of a NFLX subscription each month thereafter. Not to mention it’s much easier to cancel a NFLX subscription but harder to cancel a PTON subscription after one shells out $2,500 for the bike. If anything, the user will sell their bike to another person who will then purchase a subscription- so in a sense, a subscriber is never lost. 

Also PTON is a CULT. People are so obsessed with the company that when any new product is released, they will buy it. Example me. I have the money (partly thanks to PTON) and the real estate in my house for the PTON tread. I will be buying this treadmill now that it is available in my area and if I’m still fortunate enough to be in a good financial spot when PTON’s rower comes out, then I’ll buy that shit too! That’s 50 years’ worth of Netflix subscription revenue in just three Peloton purchases by one customer.

Yet NFLX’s P/S ratio is much higher than PTON’s…

Bear with me here. I am using price-to-sales ratio to compare NFLX and PTON. To get this number I will be using their current market capitalization divided by what I anticipate their 2021 revenue will be. The reason I am doing this is because Peloton is growing so fast that using their previous 12 months would be useless.

Lets say NFLX revenue for 2021 revenue will be 25 billion. At its current mkt cap of 230 billion and anticipated 2021 revenue of 25 billion, it has a price to sales ratio of 9.2.

Since Peloton revenue has nearly grown 100 percent year over year for the past 5 years, combined with coronavirus and its massive network effect, I don’t think its unreasonable to assign Peloton a 2021 revenue guidance of 2.9 billion. With today’s market cap of 17.88 billion divided by my 2.9 billion-dollar 2021 revenue estimate, we get a price to sales ratio of 6.16. 

This means PTON will need to jump almost 50 percent to have the same P/S ratio as NFLX. Given my points above, PTON should have a higher P/S ratio than NFLX. 

Using Netflix’s price to sale ratio, I don’t think it’s unreasonable for PTON to reach $100 a share in early 2021. This is all contingent upon John Foley’s 2021 guidance which we will hear in early August. 

Side note: Yes - I have been the PTON hype man since March (check my prior posts) I am up 160k so far on PTON and have moved all that money into PTON shares for a dollar cost average of $52. Currently I own 3,000 shares of the stock and do not plan to sell a single share until we hit $150 per share which I predict will happen within the next three years.

TLDR: for everyone who hated on my previous PTON posts, here's another opportunity to hate further and reinforce my conviction. Remember, always inverse WSB.

Which is a $450million tax write off. Not to mention their Azure cloud storage. This should be a massive spike for their business. Oh! And over 64million computers sold this quarter with MSFT 10 on all of them.  And with new statistics saying 1/3 of jobs can be done from home, I think a shit ton of companies will stay that way since it decreases their overhead when they won't have to lease as much space for offices.

Read the letter to shareholders, specifically the paragraph and chart on page 2.

If you read beyond the CNBC headlines, you would understand why EPS was down and had a ""weak third quarter guidance"". I do not have any positions in Netflix and have no bias for this company, but they definitely benefited from the current situation. Algorithmic trading scan the headlines. Investors read the financials. At least read the financials if you invest in Netflix or the sector they operate in.

Per CNBC, ""Netflix missed analyst expectations on earnings per share largely due to a one-time charge in California related to research and development tax credits.""

Per letter to shareholders, ""We added a Q2-record  10.1m  paid  memberships  vs.  2.7m  in  last  year’s  Q2.  The  positive  variance  relative to  our  7.5m  forecast  was  due  to  better-than-forecast  acquisition  and  retention.  **In  the  first  half  of  this year,  we’ve  added  26m  paid  memberships,  nearly  on  par  with  the  28m  we  achieved  in  all  of  2019.** However,  as  we  expected  (and  can  be  seen  in  the  graph  below),  growth  is  slowing  as  consumers  get through  the  initial  shock  of  Covid  and  social  restrictions.  Our  paid  net  additions  for  the  month  of  June also  included  the  subscriptions  we cancelled  for  the  small  percentage  of  members  who  had  not  used  the service  recently. The  quarterly  guidance  we  provide  is  our  actual  internal  forecast  at  the  time  we  report  and  we  strive  for accuracy.  We  forecast  2.5m  paid  net  adds  for  Q3’20  vs.  6.8m  in  the  prior  year  quarter.  **As  we  indicated  in our  Q1’20  letter,  we’re  expecting  paid  net  adds  will  be  down  year  over  year  in  the  second  half  as  our strong  first  half  performance  likely  pulled  forward  some  demand  from  the  second  half  of  the  year.**

1114,1114,2020-07-17,"NFLX is Set to Gain [Prediction] I figured I would share my intuition here since I've been trading for years and I know a gainer when I see one. I'll keep it short since I know a lot of you refuse to read >500 words.

Today, Netflix dropped 10% in after-hours trading largely due to earnings missing the target, Ted Sarandos being named co-CEO, and shareholders selling their short term gains from quarantine.

On 13Jul and 14Jul Netflix dropped 10% and the catalyst was UBS analyst Eric Sheridan changing his position from ""buy"" to ""neutral."" This was the activation energy that the bears, mainly Michael Pachter, needed to to drive the stock down.

Both of these movements were based entirely on speculations, except the underperforming Q2 earnings call (which barely missed), which means the stock is due for resurgence after these very short term news stories die down.

As for recent news, California and other states have reverted back to quarantine which will bring the stock back to green.

1116,1116,2020-07-17,"$NFLX - some of Wall Street's thoughts post Q2 miss Mostly Bullish:

* Morgan Stanley - ""  Beyond the outperformance in the quarter, we highlight three positive trends heading into 2H20 and beyond.First, churn continues to be down YoY and is below pre-COVID (early2020) levels even as many geographies have re-opened. This suggests that the extent of the demand ""pull forward""effect is modest. Second,engagement trends have come off peak levels but remain above pre-COVID levels, suggesting that Netflix could consider price adjustments earlier than we are forecasting. Engagement is one of the signals we believe the company considers when implementing rate increases. Given a largely fixed cost business, price increases drive high incremental margins and earnings upside.Finally, with the majority of Netflix's production occurring outside the US combined with massive efforts to re-imagine production in a post COVID world and selectively acquiring third party content,2021 original deliveries should be higher than 2020 for the year and in each individual quarter. While Netflix faces a challenging 1H21 compare, the year should bring an even stronger content offering than 2020"" 
* RBC - "" In our 6/8 Updating The Long Thesis report, we highlighted how our International surveys have consistently indicated higher Sat Scores than in the U.S. and detailed all the LLO success Netflix was generating. Our conclusion was that NFLX may be able to achieve global (ex-CCP) broadband household penetration similar to what it has achieved in North America (57% & rising). On roughly 800MM bband HHs, that’s approaching 500MM subs. And that could translate into $50 in EPS… which could translate into $1,000+ in price (20X+P/E) in the long-term. At the margin, we are more confident in this outlook, even if the Q3 Subs guide looks soft. We see conservatism consistent with Q2 outlook. Key theme from the EPS call was International. And it’s a bonus to hear that Reed is “in it for a decade.” We sense the company is looking to flex its pricing power (a + catalyst), and we see the new FCF power of NFLX (15% Q2 FCF margin) attracting a broader range of investors. Reit Outperform.""
* Goldman Sachs - "" While we expected even more significant upside to consensus estimates given the strength in downloads and declining churn, looking beyond the current crisis we continue to believe that Netflix’s massive content investments (Exhibit 3), global distribution ecosystem and improving competitive position will further drive financial results significantly above consensus expectations. We remain Buy rated (on CL) though we lower our 12-month price target to $600 from $670 to reflect our revised estimates.""
* BMO - ""Once again, next quarter’s guidance disappointed, and once again, we recommend buying the weakness as: 1) the 3Q guide comes in the face of a historically strong 1H20 sub additions; 2) we expect price increases to pick up in 2H20; and 3) guidance for flat to positive FCF in 2020 gives us increased confidence in a consistent turn beginning in 2022. We continue to believe the latter point will attract more focus over the next 12 months as underappreciated content cost leverage becomes better understood. ""
* Jefferies - "" While the soft 3Q outlook may put the stock in the penalty box near-term, there is no change to our positive LT thesis. We view NFLX as a consistent high double-digit growth story with sizable margin expansion over time. We expressed caution heading into the print given the swift stock move and elevated multiple, but we would use any persistent near-term weakness as an opportunity to accumulate shares. PT to $550, implies 42x EBITDA (vs a 37% 3 yr forward CAGR)""
* Canaccord Genuity - "" Netflix continued to benefit from increased consumption of SVOD content during Q2, with the \~26M net adds from 1H20 coming close to the total subscribers the company added in all of 2019 (\~28M). Engagement across all cohorts remained strong on the heels of a steady stream of popular original TV and film titles across a variety of genres, ranging from teen dramas to reality dating series and children’s films. The company also announced several management changes, including Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos also becoming co-CEO with Reed Hastings, who reiterated his continuity as a CEO, and Greg Peters taking on the COO role in addition to his current role as a Chief Product Officer. While lighter-than-expected Q3 guidance implies that there may have been a pull forward of demand over recent months, management reiterated that its 2H20 and FY21 content slate remains largely intact despite the impact of COVID-19 on production globally, which should support further subscriber growth over time. Netflix's content library investment allowed the company to evolve from a platform to watch re-runs to a quality source of original content, and now a destination for some of the biggest movie premieres, which makes the service an essential part of any consumer entertainment bundle. ""
* Pivotal - "" While the materially better than expected subscriber results were driven by the global stay-at-home orders related to the unfortunate COVID-19 virus our view remains that COVID-19 is simply accelerating trends already in place away from traditional PayTV to DTC \[with 2Q clearly going to be the worst PayTV result in history in the U.S.\] and cementing NFLX’s position as the dominant global DTC operator for the foreseeable future. Subscriber growth is the flywheel that drives a virtuous cycle for NFLX as the larger their subscriber base grows the more they can invest in original content which increases the target market for their service (and reduces existing subscriber churn) + enhances their ability to take future price increases and dramatically increases barriers to entry, boosted by continued material increases in broadband availability/speeds globally and the fact that on most of earth net neutrality regulations allow NFLX to piggy back for nearly free on the substantial investment to increase broadband speeds made by telecom companies. Post these results we net net tweaked our 2020 full year subscriber forecasts moderately lower which was more than offset by the nicely better than expected expense trends (even adjusting for the effects of Covid-19) which led to a modest $20 increase in our YE’20 target to $600 (based on DCF 23X ’25 terminal EBITDA and an 8% d. rate)."" 

Bearish:

* Credit Suisse - ""  We are downgrading Netflix from an Outperform to a Neutral due to a lack of near term catalysts. Serious investor concerns regarding the “3 C’s” (competition; content quality; cost of content) have waned, appropriately so in our view, while Netflix has benefitted from a particularly strong content slate and the COVID crisis has been a significant accelerant for the shift to streaming globally. Looking forward, we see: (1) subdued subscriber growth in 2H20 due to the stay-at-home pull forward into 1H20 (26m 1H net adds vs. 12m last year), and unlike the similar 1Q20 pull-forward concerns, there is evidence sub growth has already slowed based on the weekly subscriber chart in management’s 2Q letter; (2) obviously difficult 1H21 comparisons, exacerbated by mgmt. indicating top hits in the 2021 content slate will be 2H-weighted, competing content will have re-ramped (sports, theatrical releases, fresh linear content), and we expect price increases to kick in late 2020 to mid-2021 (the last was early/mid 2019), likely further hampering net adds (mgmt. is targeting revenue growth, but investors are targeting subscriber growth); and (3) investor interest in Netflix as a stay-at-home “winner” might taper off with countries reopening. Our long-term view of Netflix as the clear global subscription streaming leader is unchanged, but to shift the valuation paradigm from these levels would require, in our view, investors: (1) adding mobile to TAM; (2) assuming Netflix will be able to bundle and sell more products with its service; or (3) anticipating robust FCF and its deployment.""
* Needham - ""Caution Advised. Trouble Ahead? Analysis: 1) Live sports was dark, cinemas, theaters, music festivals, theme parks, cruises etc (ie, competitors for time) were closed for all of 2Q20, NFLX was the only company consistently airing new content throughout the quarter, and billions of potential subs were sheltering at home owing to health or government official directives. How does it get any better for NFLX? 2) We agree with NFLX that some sub adds were pulled forward from future periods. We believe NFLX valuations have downside risk if/when NFLX adds return to a more normalized trend line. 3) To justify NFLX's current valuation based on FCF, we calculate that NFLX must triple revenue to $70B and paid subs must reach 500mm paying an avg of $11/month, based on 2Q20's FCF/ revs ratio of 15%. RISKY BUSINESS NFLX characterizes part of their current sub growth during COVID-19 as pulling forward sub adds. We agree. By implication, consumer demand isn't getting larger, so future sub additions will fall to or below the trend line of prior years as the perfect storm of 2Q20 benefits to NFLX ends (ie, live sports return, production resumes, lock downs lift, etc). At valuation multiples of 10x revenue and a PE of 60x, can NFLX rise during the correction back to its more normal trend line? We note that global sub adds have flattened since May 1.""

Sort of on the fence:

* Oppenheimer - "" Raising target to $515 from $480 and maintaining our Outperform rating, as we believe the current environment continues to favor NFLX's global production capabilities and extensive content library vs. competitors. 2Q results pointed to a further sub pullforward from COVID-19, with 1H:20 net adds of 26M nearly eclipsing FY19 net adds of 28M. However, new subs typically churn at a higher rate than legacy subs and the global reopening likely causes slower gross adds. 3Q adds guided 59% below top quartile of Street estimates, suggesting recent bulls got ahead of themselves. Global production of originals in most markets resumed. Mgmt. conservatively maintaining FY margin guidance, even though YTD tracking ahead, with likely upside to FY21E, based on comments of potential '21 international price hikes.""
* Piper Sandler - "" Netflix sub net adds for Q2'20 beat consensus, driven by ""stay-at-home"" policies amid Covid. Guidance for Q3'20 sub net adds is below expectations, but Covid will likely impact results. Netflix also announced Ted Sarandos as Co-CEO and board member. For Q2'20, Global net adds were 10.1M vs. Street at 8.3M. Q2'20 EPS was $1.59, below consensus of $1.82 while Rev was $6.15B vs Street at $6.09B. Sub growth did not translate to stronger EPS, due in part to FX headwinds ($289M impact) offsetting savings on marketing and content expenses that drove op margin to 22% (street at 18%). Sub outlook for Q3'20 is 2.5M globally, below the Street at 5.4M. We reiterate our OW rating and raise our PT to $534 from $500 PT on an increased \~60x (from \~57x) '21 EPS.

1125,1125,2020-07-21,"Incoming Tesla (TSLA) ""𝗜𝗻𝗳𝗶𝗻𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗦𝗾𝘂𝗲𝗲𝘇𝗲"" **TL;DR:** A bit of DD for those wondering about what's going on with TSLA's recent sharp rise: a dramatic contraction of the ""free float"", which could trigger episodes of delta-hedging and short covering fueled positive feedback loops, also known as an ""Infinity Squeeze"".

----

The most amazing infinity squeeze in history was VW's in 2008, when VW shares went from below €200 to over €1,000 within a single trading week, because there were more short positions than shares available (""free float contraction""):

> [**""Hedge funds lose $30 billion on VW infinity squeeze""**](https://moxreports.com/vw-infinity-squeeze/)

Think about that, hedge funds shorted an **automaker** in fucking ***2008***, straight during the Lehman episode & meltdown, when demand for new cars cratered, i.e. this was the best possible cannot-go-tits-up Big Short leveraged trade a fellow autist can dream up during a financial crisis, and they were *still* forced out of their positions in a massive short squeeze...

----
Fast forward to 2020, during a raging bull market backstopped by Powell's brrrrrrrr machine, with over a million Robinhood retail traders armed with ~~financial weapons of mass destruction~~ leveraged options, and cue in Tesla's potential S&P 500 addition, which would add TSLA with a bang at a nearly 1% weight: at today's $1,650+ price over $100b worth of TSLA shares (over 63m shares) will be held by passive and active funds benchmarked to the S&P 500, in perhaps the most massive anti-dilutive share buyback program in history.

For those who want to watch this on video, here's a high quality analysis of the S&P 500 inclusion from Tesla Daily:

> [""Will Tesla Stock Keep Going Up? Exploring the Mechanics of S&P 500 Inclusion (TSLA)""](https://twitter.com/TeslaPodcast/status/1282932750543093760)

Or another look at the float contraction caused by Tesla's S&P 500 inclusion:

> [""Tesla's S&P 500 Inclusion: Predicting TSLA's post-inclusion stock price""](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/hsvqus/teslas_sp_500_inclusion_predicting_tslas/)

What neither the video nor the post detailed sufficiently are the non-dilutive & float contraction effects of **options**, the delta hedging inventory in particular, which is somewhere around ~40m TSLA shares today, or 27% of the float - and which **goes up non-linearly as the TSLA price appreciates**.

Today there's a near record amount of TSLA options open interest: 800,000 call contracts and 1,200,000 put contracts, representing a huge delta hedging range of +80m and -120m TSLA shares - but with a current bias for upward skewed TSLA price moves. A +$200 move in TSLA generates about 5,500,000 shares worth of TSLA buying by market makers. (-4% float contraction)

And today a record value of TSLA shares are shorted (over $20b short interest VAR), with a short squeeze ""ongoing"" according to short squeeze experts S3 Partners, who called the early 2020 TSLA short squeeze:

> [""With the market rising there will be more short squeezes, such as $TSLA, as short sellers buy-to-cover as losses mount""](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1285251199889965057)

If we add up the various TSLA shareholder categories who **must** or are strongly incentivized to hold TSLA, we get:

Shareholders | float taken out of circulation
---|---
Passive index funds |  26,000,000 shares
Active funds benchmarked to the S&P 500 | 37,000,000 shares
Delta-hedging at $1,500 | ~40,000,000 shares or more
Non-S&P-500 indices already holding TSLA | ~20,000,000 shares
Shorts covering | up to ~5,000,000 shares (14m shares short today)
 | =
SUM | = ~128,000,000 shares
total free float | = ~147,000,000 shares

Most of these entities **will be forced to buy TSLA at any price** and will take those shares out of circulation for a long time.

The next time the index funds will even consider selling some of their TSLA will be after the December reindexing, and because historically Tesla's Q3 and Q4 are the strongest quarters, there's a fair chance that the TSLA weight will further increase in December, triggering *more* accumulation.

Yeah, **over 85% of the float will be locked up by long-term holders** - or short covering which destroys virtual long shares anti-dilutively, which is recipe for a short squeeze + delta hedging positive feedback loop to drive an ""Infinity Squeeze"" to infinity and beyond. (In reality I think a trillion dollars valuation at $5,400 will probably be a limit to any spike.)

For the ""it's already priced in!"" crew: **it cannot be priced in** due to a design flaw in the S&P 500 methodology (which flaw modern indices do not have), despite everyone knowing about S&P 500 inclusion, the ""Index Effect"" is real and substantial, because $4.6t of passive S&P 500 index funds **cannot buy before inclusion**, and because the Tesla event is so fucking huge &  unprecedented.

For those who like to combine fundamental analysis with technical indicators and quant arguments, TSLA trading volume is already showing signs of 'float contraction':

- Yesterday 17.7m TSLA shares were traded, which is **over 12% of the TSLA free float**, in a single trading day.
- Last week over 105m TSLA shares were traded, which is **over 70% of the TSLA free float**, in a single trading week
- Last month over 300m TSLA shares were traded, which is **over 200% of the TSLA free float**

As a comparison: last week, when AAPL has hit new all-time highs, the turnover was just 4% of the float (!)...

A TSLA infinity squeeze will be slower than the VW squeeze IMO, but with a more permanent price increase, and during what appears to be a bull market so far.

Tomorrow Tesla will report Q2 earnings, which Wall Street expectations are an EPS loss and a GAAP loss.

If Tesla beats expectations and posts a profit, no matter how small, it will become eligible for the S&P 500.

Timeline of the addition: while the next S&P 500 index rebalancing occurs on September 18, **there's no such timetable to additions**, which can be announced as quickly as 1 week after the company reports results - or as late as 7 weeks after the ER. This is one of the reason why many funds cannot buy TSLA in advance.

If Tesla is added then big index funds will get a couple of days advance notice from the S&P 500 committee - but for that Tesla has to post profits first, which is uncertain.

Disclaimer: this is not advice, I might be wrong & degenerate, trade on your own risk and gamble responsibly!

----

**TL;DR:** If this indeed happens (which it might not), then pretty much any TSLA call options post the S&P 500 announcement will go up in value.

1139,1139,2020-07-23,"Every single stock purchase I've made this year has been a loss. 100% failure rate. I've read countless books on fundamental analysis, including the Intelligent Investor. Dozens of swing trading books, technical analysis books, and day trading strategies. I've taken online courses through my local University in finance (working on an MBA). I do hours upon hours of research before investing in anything, yet everything I touch just gets destroyed. I bought Novagold this year. Next day, short report. Stock plummets. Luckin Coffee? Scandal, fraud, delisted twice, worthless stock. I bought BEN thinking it was a wise long call for dividend growth. Just keeps plummeting. When I bought Tesla and Netflix, they both sank. I've bought endless stocks when they've hit below the lower bollinger bands, and everytime I do, they just go lower (with no news mind you). I bought AAPL yesterday, thinking $386 was a good discount value purchase. PLUMMETING AGAIN. I just don't get it. When a company comes out with a great earnings report and I buy, the stock tanks. When a company comes out with bad earnings, it goes straight up after I short it. I could literally pull letters out of a hat and have better success.

Edit:  I should point out that I do day trade, and I wasn't actually referring to day trading, which I feel like is just a different game than investing.  Thanks to the PDT rule, I can only trade 3x per week, and every week all my profits are offset by my investments.

FINAL EDIT:  I'd just like to point out to save my sanity and refresh my outlook on life.  When the pandemic was at the bottom and I was getting into investing hardcore, I changed my and my wife's retirement allocations into index fund investments, so there's that.  Retirement funds are up 20% since April, which is crazy.  Thank god I'm not allowed to invest in individual stocks with my 403b.

Edit:  Wow, this sub is great!  I am already feeling a lot better.  Never seen support in any other sub like this and was honestly just not checking my inbox because I assumed I was going to just get trolled all day.  Thanks for the wise words and support friends!

European stocks fell sharply on Friday, as technology stocks tumbled and investors were no longer able to shrug off escalating tensions between the U.S. and China.

The pan-European Stoxx 600 [**SXXP,** **-1.70%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/SXXP?countryCode=XX&mod=MW_story_quote) slipped 1.7%, with tech stocks falling 3.8%.

Asian markets tumbled overnight as Beijing retaliated against the U.S. after the Trump administration ordered the closure of the Chinese consulate in Houston. China ordered the U.S. to close its own [consulate in Chengdu](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/china-orders-us-consulate-in-chengdu-closed-in-growing-spat-2020-07-24?mod=home-page), as the spat between the world’s two largest economies intensified.

Hong Kong’s Hang Seng [**HSI,** **-2.20%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/HSI?countryCode=HK&mod=MW_story_quote) index fell 2.6%, while China’s Shanghai Composite [**SHCOMP,** **-3.86%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/SHCOMP?countryCode=CN&mod=MW_story_quote) slumped 3.9%. The negative sentiment, compounded by U.S. tech stocks falling late on Thursday, spilled over into the European open.

“The fear is that this might only be the start of a re-escalation in tensions between the two superpowers,” Spreadex analyst Connor Campbell said, as President Donald Trump seeks to “distract” from the domestic situation in America ahead of the Presidential election.

There was some good news in Europe, but it was largely ignored by investors, given the broader mood early on Friday.

French business activity beat expectations in July, rebounding more than expected after lockdown measures were lifted, according to the closely-followed purchasing managers index. The German manufacturing sector also avoided a contraction for the first time in 19 months. In further positive signs, U.K. retail sales [surged 13.9% in June](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/uk-retail-sales-surge-139-in-june-2020-07-24?mod=home-page), beating consensus estimates of a 8.3% rise, with sales now higher than they were precrisis.

It's interesting to hear how Buffett was thinking about Microsoft at the time. Especially his comparison to Coca-Cola. He obviously liked Microsoft and was believed they would continue to grow, but didn't have quite enough certainty about Microsoft's future to make an investment.

I really like this approach to investing. Perhaps not investing in Microsoft can be seen as a mistake in hindsight, but then again I'm sure over his career Buffett has managed to stir clear of many bad investments with this approach. 

I've always thought the most important lesson to learn as an investor isn't how to make money, but how to not lose it.

Robinhood day traders swarmed to Eastman Kodak Co. shares as the stock rallied 1,600% this week.

As of 11 a.m. in New York on Wednesday, 43,000 users of the investing app had added [Kodak](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/KODK:US) to their accounts in some form over the past 24 hours, according to website Robintrack.net, which aggregates data from the brokerage but isn’t affiliated with it. The activity was 20 times more than the next most-popular stock, Actinium Pharmaceuticals Inc. Roughly 27,000 of the additions came over a four-hour span earlier Wednesday.

 

The growing presence of retail investors has become a popular markets narrative this year with zero commission fees and the potential for entertainment in a world largely without sports or gambling luring a new crop of traders. The impact they have on prices is unclear, but similar buying sprees have erupted in pockets of the equity market, including electric-vehicle firms, shares of companies in bankruptcy protection and increasingly pharmaceutical stocks. Earlier this month, Tesla Inc. attracted Robinhood traders at a pace of [10,000 an hour](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-13/ten-thousand-day-traders-an-hour-pour-into-tesla).

Kodak -- famous for its pioneering work in film photography -- surged 331% to $34.24 as of 11:34 a.m in New York.

These are the most important numbers from the report compared to analysts’ expectations as compiled by Bloomberg.

* **Revenue:** $59.69 billion versus $52.3 billion expected
* **Earnings per share:** $2.58 versus $2.07 expected
* **iPhone revenue:** $26.42 billion versus $30.9 billion expected.
* **Services revenue:** $13.2 billion versus $13.1 billion expected
* **Accessories:** $6.5 billion versus $6.1 billion expected

Apple’s earnings come just a day after CEO Tim Cook sat before the House Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial, and Administrative Law to answer accusations that the company abuses its market power to [stifle competition in the Apple App Store](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-ceo-tim-cook-hit-with-questions-on-app-store-dominance-during-antitrust-hearing-224150894.html).

The company’s Q3 report, however, hasn’t been much of a focus for analysts, as much of the conversation about Apple has revolved around the tech giant’s upcoming launch of its iPhone 12. The next-generation iPhone is expected to be Apple’s first 5G-capable device and could lead to a so-called “super cycle,” during which the company would see a larger than normal uptick in iPhone sales.

The idea is that consumers who have held on to their devices for several years will jump at the chance to get a new iPhone with a new form of cellular connectivity that promises dramatically increased data.

But with consumer personal consumption spending in Q2 [falling a whopping 34.6%](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/q2-gdp-us-economy-coronavirus-pandemic-consumer-171558880.html) due to COVID-19 shutdowns, and more than [50 million Americans out of the workforce](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jobless-claims-week-ending-july-25-123150219.html), investor hopes of a massive uptick in year-over-year iPhone sales in the coming quarters may not be in the cards.

1161,1161,2020-07-30,"Where is AAPL going after the split? We learned today what has been true since the ipod:  Apple is indirectly receiving cash from the US treasury via a long line of credit, some overseas manufacturing, artistic branding, and your mother's monthly disability check.  Straight profit.

#TLDR for u/rowdygentleman1 and his Eskimo Bros:
#AAPL is splitting 4:1 to let the gig economy workers get in on the ownership.  Why would very wealthy investors want very poor investors to come in and take a very valuable bag off their hands? The game is called when to exit.  AAPL climbs before or after split (maybe both), and drops as the rich get up from the table.  Time it right to get out before they do.  Or run with the bull pen to $150 EOY.

** *Post Continues* **

Google says a stock split is a neutral event.  Bullshit.  No one rich does anything except for them and they boys goin' get richer.  Tim not-Cook-the-books says a 4:1 split will allow more people to participate in owning Apple stock.  This implies that he sees an advantage to an over-valued Titan class tech stock being easier to own by retail investors (compared to Google, Tesla, Amazon,... Berkshire Hathaway).  Let's get real.  Retail invest investors can already buy fractional shares on the easiest app to download onto an apple iphone.  Does he think that more people would choose to buy AAPL over GOOGL or AMZN or MSFT or even NFLX?  Or that dumbass retail investors will think going from $100 --> $120 is the same as running from $380 --> $400?

In these instances, the post-split stock would quickly run up faster than pre-split, allowing Industry and Oligarchs to slip out the back door without crashing the retail party.  Then us bagholders wonder why AAPL can't climb above $125 for the next decade.

Speaking of Berkshire.  How much AAPL is coursing through Omaha's ground water?  Google says 245M shares (5.6%). Interesting. Vanguard Group owns 7.3% [and Vanguard owns 9.5% of itself, that means that Vanguard investors that own AAPL are double positioned on to AAPL].  No Ducking way these guys are pushing Tim Cook to help the small guys make money.

Assuming that AVD and BRK know the music is slowing down and they need someone to dance while they slip out the back, and assuming that a lower bar to entry means dumber, eager buyers, I present three scenarios:

1.  Stock runs up in anticipation of the split.  A future cheaper price means more investors will buy in after the split, effectively allowing current white collars to buy in bulk at a discount now over competing with the filthy wage earners later.  AVD and BRK start paring down their piggy bank.  Ease it out a few million shares a week.  Once we realize they are gone we just sit in a sideways party together.

2.  Stock is sideways to split.  Google says a stock split is neutral so nobody panics.  Inside their corner offices, V and BRK are shitting their pants.  What if retail doesn't show.  Trump might try to push off the elections and deploy BORTAC to quell transgender bathroom users in Arizona.  Retail is too busy with other shit to get a rise out of AAPL.  Once the split happens, AVD and BRK GTFO as the newest WSB boys show up to YOLO 5DTE $150 Calls.  Stock drops.  Theta gang has to payout $90 to own $80 stock.  Then they start selling $91 Calls, but WSB already YOLO'd.

#3.  AAPL runs up like #1, but then falls like #2.  Probably something to do with AVD and BRK earning statements coming out or they need to buy a shit ton of farmland from retirees right now and don't have time to tiptoe out the back.

To me, it seems impossible that AAPL drops back sub $400.  4:1, August (4x2 month) 24 (twentieth plus fourth day).  The numerology is there.  Not going below $400.  It also seems impossible to me that we will continue to see 83% annual gains for AAPL after the retail fuck-bois drive up the post split price.  I won't get a bear tatoo, but I think this split is a sign of the smart money trying to sneak out. (I've said that like five times now.)

What do you think?  I'm cashing out my $380/$400 spread ASAP and then going to stare deeply into a JPOW deepfake to internalize whether I'm more afraid of bagholding or gaining massive tendies ala TSLA.

#**Edit** 

Our boy u/pavemental brought up a great point about the Stimulus checks. Goddamn AAPL is going to $120.

I/pootytang13- asks a great question:

>You realize Apple continues to increase their stock buybacks? They already bought back 480 billion dollars worth. Why would they stop after the split? Why would institutions get out ??

*I typed out a response, and then realized my answers were much longer than the questions. So I place them below.*

All good questions. Why does a company buy back stock? As a way to deliver rewards to investors via capital gains. Obviously they could instead pay a larger dividend, but the decision to purchase stock means the most influential investors (the ones with the real say in the company) have a preference for higher share prices over straight receipt of cash.

I never implied that Apple would discontinue their buyback program. Indeed the safest place for a mountain of dollars in a inflationary environment is in a capital asset. Apple is keenly at risk as their hoard is legendary.

Finally, why would the largest institutions want to pare down their AAPL holdings? We already discussed the dividend being low priority in a inflationary environment. So we can assume they aren't cashing out to swim in a pool of golden dollars. The two alternatives I posit are 1) stay vested or even double down, 2) find larger earnings elsewhere. 

Did you know the real growth is not in the stock market? In fact, one could say the stock market is smaller than it's ever been in terms of businesses present. The real money is in private equity. You have to know someone to get in. You have to bring real money to get in. Not our dumbass $400/share. Think BRK/A scale.

Perhaps the largest institutional investigators want to draw even more retail investment into AAPL just to see big gains. Or perhaps as the real economy crashes, capital intensive shit like farms and railroad are beginning to sell for discounts. Shit we will need when people can get back to work. Maybe now is the time to slide out of the hyper-valued tech sector and pick up the actual levers of industry.

Or maybe they (the influential investors) simply see the opportunity to personally gain from high share holdings.  A la Pump no dump.  Their separate business models may indirectly benefit from a high AAPL valuation. However a straight Pump implies that the valuation will pause or slowly settle to pre-pump excitement, meaning their indirect benefit must have short term goals.

What i'm trying to say is, If it wasn't for the Tik Tokers pissing off Cheeto Man, I probably would have been broke. These options are currenly worth about a buck.

In October of 2018, /u/Mr_Suzan was inspired by a post from /u/galloog1 to seek out underrated stock picks from the /r/investing community and monitor their performance.  


Post-COVID bounce, I wanted to see how these picks have performed, so I've gathered them all here.

A few of these have earnings posting soon, so the ranks may change, but overall it looks like a solid performance by the community.  Any new underrated stocks to think about?  

&nbsp;

# Some quick stats:

- Overall average return: ~33% (compared to ~18% for the S&P 500)

- Equal rated return: ~50% (as pointed out by /u/csp256)

- Return on the most upvoted pick: Disney (DIS) 1%

- Highest returning pick: Enphase (ENPH) 1110% (recommended by /u/williemax)

- If you invested in the top 5 most upvoted stocks, you would have seen a 27% return

- If you invested in the top 5 most controversial stocks, you would have seen a 99% return

- The top 10 gainers in order were ENPH, TSLA, APT, DXCM, OKTA, AYX, BAND, ALU, WIX, LRCX

- If you had picked one of these stocks at random, you would have had a ~53% chance of >10% gains and a ~19% chance of >100% gains

Submit your picks for the community to track Following on the previous tracking post ([http://redd.it/i2mmzg](http://redd.it/i2mmzg))  and the highly upvoted request from /u/DJ-Ascii , I've set up this post for another round of underrated or undervalued stock picks.

As before, let us know what stock you believe is underrated and a consistent winner that has done well for you, or you believe will do well going forward.

In order to make this easier to track please use the following guidelines for submitting.

1. Only one submission per comment. You can make multiple comments, but please only submit one stock per comment.
2. Please include at least the ticker and the company name. Feel free to explain why you think this is a good stock.

I'll add these new picks alongside the old survey so as to update you on each portfolio over time.  Don't worry about any overlaps.

Edit 1: I've compiled everyone who has posted so far, but I'll look out for any final additions tomorrow.  The list will then be locked EOD on Friday the 7th of August, and all prices will start from there.

Edit 2: All picks have now been locked down and consolidated into the list below.  Stocks are sorted in alphabetical order of their company name and the ID corresponds to the approximate order in which they were submitted.  The next update will be in 30 days.

5. Apple Pay and other transaction facilitation platforms

7. Their growing services portfolios

9. Others. :)

1202,1202,2020-08-12,"GOOG vs AAPL? Which do you prefer longterm? Been thinking of whether I should trim my apple or google positions and honestly...feeling kinda bearish on Google.

Google has been lagging QQQ for a while now. I guess partly due to the ad cutting due to corona. But it also seems like their ad revenue growth has been decelerating for other reasons with a lot of players attacking the space from different angles (Amzn,TTD, Roku, FB, ramp etc).

 Their company culture is heavily based around engineering yet not so savvy when it comes to product marketing and expanding shareholder value. They come up with cool tech but seem to always be either too late or too early to the party. Google glasses didn't pan out, pixel phones are a modest success but not taking the industry by storm, google shopping is a money sink, Google fiber was curtailed, Fitbit acquisition is kind of iffy (Samsung/Garmin/Apple already dominate the space across respective demographics). They keep selling the AI future but Waymo seems to be the only thing they have going here that can turn out to be truly profitable. Will that be enough though?

Apple on the other hand knows how to drive share price. Always doing buybacks. Although they are historically a hardware focused company they are transitioning more and more into the services industry with their popular app store, Apple TV+, apple pay etc. Seems like this will be their long-term pivot. And road ahead seems more clearer to me than Google's.

1205,1205,2020-08-13,"Apple & Tesla Announced Stock Splits; Here’s How It Could Impact Your Investments ## What’s A Stock Split And How It Could Affect Your Current Holdings

Apple and Tesla, arguably two of the hottest companies on [Wall Street](http://www.stockmarket.com/investing), both announced stock splits in recent weeks. The question is, can it positively affect your current holdings? First, let’s understand what a stock split is. Essentially, a stock split is exactly what it sounds like. One share is splitting up into a few individual shares. This often comes after a particular share price has been inflated to a level that may be ‘too high’. For example, in [Tesla](https://stockmarket.com/ticker?symbol=TSLA) 5-for-1 stock split example, one share worth $1500 now will be broken into 5 shares worth $300 each. This way, it will lower the entry barrier for investors who wish to buy a stake in the company.

A stock split can typically result in a share price increase following a decrease immediately after the split. Since many retail investors find the stock now more affordable, they end up boosting demand and driving up prices. A stock split also reminds investors that the share price had been increasing in the past. It is not surprising that many investors extrapolate the historical growth into the future and bid up the share price again. One thing to also note is that even though the number of outstanding shares increases and stock price decreases, the market capitalization doesn’t change.

# Who Tend To Benefit From Stock Splits?

Generally speaking, stock splits are neutral events for current shareholders. In the case of the Apple 4-for-1 stock split, you used to own 1 share, but moving forward you will own 4, but the total value remains the same. Essentially, a stock split wouldn’t change the company value, all else being equal. But the truth is, all else is rarely equal when we apply it in the market.

Both TSLA stock and [AAPL stock](https://stockmarket.com/ticker?symbol=AAPL) jumped after the announcement. This may be the fifth time for Apple to do a stock split, but it is Tesla’s first. The price change will be more dramatic for Tesla, whose stock split will bring individual share to the $300 range. Compared to Apple’s post-split of $100 range, Tesla’s post-split stock might find it harder to attract smaller investors.

Certain online brokerages offer investors to buy fractional stocks. Conceptually, it offers the same thing in the absence of stock splits. Then again, not all brokerages will offer such services and it’s not that easy to move shares between brokerages. Therefore, it will not create a much stronger demand than actual stock splits. Now, like it or not, news of stock splits tend to cause share prices to jump. And that is not really rational. But who cares? As long as the prices go up, existing shareholders would not be complaining.

## Tesla & Apple’s Stock Splits Could Restart The Trend Again.

Is stock splits a thing in the past? Tracing back the history, in 1997, 102 companies in the [S&P 500](https://stockmarket.com/ticker?symbol=SPY) split their stocks, and in 2016, only 7 companies did so, a decline of more than 90%. That is about to change when two of the hottest tech companies announced they will be splitting their shares at the end of this month. The zero brokerage fees environment gives companies a greater incentive to split shares today. In addition, it creates a more affordable and accessible stock for Robinhood traders to start trading. After all, many retail investors are nonetheless still prone to judging how “expensive” a stock is based on its dollar value. That said, it is not surprising to see other tech companies like Amazon, Shopify, or Alphabet make such moves on their own timeline.",AAPL,apple tesla announced stock split ’ could impact investment ’ stock split could affect current holding apple tesla arguably two hottest company wall streethttpwwwstockmarketcominvesting announced stock split recent week question positively affect current holding first let ’ understand stock split essentially stock split exactly sound like one share splitting individual share often come particular share price inflated level may ‘ high ’ example teslahttpsstockmarketcomtickersymboltsla 5for1 stock split example one share worth 1500 broken 5 share worth 300 way lower entry barrier investor wish buy stake company stock split typically result share price increase following decrease immediately split since many retail investor find stock affordable end boosting demand driving price stock split also reminds investor share price increasing past surprising many investor extrapolate historical growth future bid share price one thing also note even though number outstanding share increase stock price decrease market capitalization ’ change tend benefit stock split generally speaking stock split neutral event current shareholder case apple 4for1 stock split used 1 share moving forward 4 total value remains essentially stock split ’ change company value else equal truth else rarely equal apply market tsla stock aapl stockhttpsstockmarketcomtickersymbolaapl jumped announcement may fifth time apple stock split tesla ’ first price change dramatic tesla whose stock split bring individual share 300 range compared apple ’ postsplit 100 range tesla ’ postsplit stock might find harder attract smaller investor certain online brokerage offer investor buy fractional stock conceptually offer thing absence stock split brokerage offer service ’ easy move share brokerage therefore create much stronger demand actual stock split like news stock split tend cause share price jump really rational care long price go existing shareholder would complaining tesla apple ’ stock split could restart trend stock split thing past tracing back history 1997 102 company sp 500httpsstockmarketcomtickersymbolspy split stock 2016 7 company decline 90 change two hottest tech company announced splitting share end month zero brokerage fee environment give company greater incentive split share today addition creates affordable accessible stock robinhood trader start trading many retail investor nonetheless still prone judging “ expensive ” stock based dollar value said surprising see tech company like amazon shopify alphabet make move timeline,Positive,0.9961

1228,1228,2020-08-20,"TSLA red tomorrow as options pushing stock up expire **Unusual Tesla Option Trades Pushing Stock Higher And Higher
Today 1:31 PM ET (Benzinga) Print**

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) once again traded sharply higher by 6.2% on Thursday, briefly touching the $2,000 level, despite no major news from the company.

Tesla shares are now up 77% in the past year as the company has made a profit in four straight quarters, and some say strange option trading activity could be driving the recent gains.

The Trades: On Thursday, Tesla’s sharp intraday rise coincided with large trading volume in some significantly out-of-the-money Tesla call options expiring on Friday.

“Actually… someone is buying a LOT of 8/21 $2,100 call options,” GLJ Research founder Gordon Johnson told Benzinga. “This has been going on a LOT (i.e., someone buying way out of the money short-dated call options, which forces the person writing these options to buy stock), which has pushed the stock up consistently.”

On Thursday morning, there were 55,616 contracts worth of volume in Tesla $2,000 call options expiring Friday and 22,892 contracts worth of volume on Friday $2,100 call options. The $2,000 strike price contracts and the $2,100 contracts have open interests of 14,798 and 5,091, respectively.

Upward Spiral: Stanphyl Capital Partners portfolio manager and Tesla short seller Mark Spiegel has also recently noticed the strange trading activity in the Tesla option market.

“Some entity — I don’t know who — was executing a strategy of buying massive quantities of out-of-the-money call options,” Spiegel said of Tesla’s huge run in 2020.

This strategy forced call option sellers to buy Tesla shares to cover their positions, according to Spiegel.

“This thing just kind of spiraled its way up,” he said.

Benzinga’s Take: There are plenty of explanations for Tesla’s insane run in 2020, including strange option trading, short squeezes, profits from regulatory credit sales, a spike in inexperienced Robinhood retail traders and the stock's inclusion in the S&P 500. However, the ultimate metrics that will define Tesla’s success or failure in the long-term are auto sales and earnings growth.",TSLA,tsla red tomorrow option pushing stock expire unusual tesla option trade pushing stock higher higher today 131 pm et benzinga print tesla inc nasdaq tsla traded sharply higher 62 thursday briefly touching 2000 level despite major news company tesla share 77 past year company made profit four straight quarter say strange option trading activity could driving recent gain trade thursday tesla ’ sharp intraday rise coincided large trading volume significantly outofthemoney tesla call option expiring friday “ actually… someone buying lot 821 2100 call option ” glj research founder gordon johnson told benzinga “ going lot ie someone buying way money shortdated call option force person writing option buy stock pushed stock consistently ” thursday morning 55616 contract worth volume tesla 2000 call option expiring friday 22892 contract worth volume friday 2100 call option 2000 strike price contract 2100 contract open interest 14798 5091 respectively upward spiral stanphyl capital partner portfolio manager tesla short seller mark spiegel also recently noticed strange trading activity tesla option market “ entity — ’ know — executing strategy buying massive quantity outofthemoney call option ” spiegel said tesla ’ huge run 2020 strategy forced call option seller buy tesla share cover position according spiegel “ thing kind spiraled way ” said tsla 3100 call expiring tomorrow bid pictwittercom7xl2ci3g52 — zerohedge zerohedge august 20 2020 benzinga ’ take plenty explanation tesla ’ insane run 2020 including strange option trading short squeeze profit regulatory credit sale spike inexperienced robinhood retail trader stock inclusion sp 500 however ultimate metric define tesla ’ success failure longterm auto sale earnings growth,Positive,0.9508
1229,1229,2020-08-20,"Why is GOOG worth so much less than AAPL, AMZN, MSFT? At time of writing, GOOG market cap is $1.06T and other tech giants are much higher (AAPL is $2.01T, AMZN is $1.65T, MSFT is $1.61T). That gap feels large to me. Also, FB is valued at $760B with much lower revenue and decelerating growth, so its gap vs GOOG seems small. 

Is GOOG a good buy? Are these other companies just overvalued? Curious what you all think.  
Here's my thinking:

* GOOG has rock-solid fundamentals - excellent gross margins, has maintained \~15%+ YoY revenue growth even at their scale, and search is a steady business with many entrypoints across the Google ecosystem
* GOOG has bets across so many forward-looking industries that I think they will be able to diversify over time and don't have real risk of not continuing to innovate. There's of course the risk of anti-trust and privacy regulations, but that's been true for years now (although things do appear to be ratcheting up).
* It seems their stock hasn't mooned during covid because a meaningful share of search volume (and subsequently search revenue) comes from brick-and-mortar businesses (as opposed to someone like FB, whose ads biz is more of an ecommerce/direct-to-consumer play), which puts a drag on their revenue. This was the main reason for their relatively weak Q2 earnings a couple weeks back.

1230,1230,2020-08-20,"Apple Hits $2 Trillion Market Cap, Is AAPL Stock Still A Buy? &#x200B;

Apple has just hit an incredible milestone. You may have guessed it. Yes, it became the first [tech stock](http://www.stockmarket.com/investing/tech-stocks) to pass the $2 trillion mark. This comes ahead of a 4-for-1 stock split that will lower the entry barrier for prospective investors to buy shares. The iPhone maker has beaten the other tech giants such as Amazon and Microsoft to reach this milestone. Of course, this is a largely symbolic figure. There’s nothing significant changing fundamentally. But the bottom line is that Apple is doing very, very well. Maybe you are like many other investors who are contemplating whether to [buy AAPL stock now](https://stockmarket.com/featured/apple-heres-how-it-could-impact-your-investments-2020-08-13). Let’s take a closer look at what’s ahead for the iPhone maker and why the growth is here to stay.

## Ongoing Transition To 5G Network To Give AAPL Stock A Boost

One of the key drivers in Apple stock growth would be the next-generation 5G mobile technology. Technology analyst Dan Ives from Wedbush said that “Apple has a ‘once in a decade’ opportunity over the next 12 to 18 months as we estimate roughly 350 million of Cupertino’s 950 million iPhones worldwide are in the window of an upgrade opportunity.”

Many experts believe the new 5G iPhone would be a game-changer and it will be a defining chapter for the world’s largest tech company. Apple is slated to launch iPhone 12 in October. The question is, how important is the iPhone 12 to Apple? Ives said that Wedbush believes that many on Wall Street “are underestimating the massive pent-up demand around this super cycle for Apple, which remains the opportunity for the bulls.”

## Apple Services & Wearables Segment Continues To Outperform

Even though the novel coronavirus continues to persist in the second quarter, Apple was able to generate growth, with revenue that increased by 1%. For the fiscal third quarter, Apple produced a record, with revenue up 11% year over year, while earnings per share grew 18%. This came amid the strong performance among tech companies. And investors have certainly been piling into tech companies that benefited during the stay-at-home orders. These include companies with products and services related to remote work, cloud computing, music, and video streaming, and digital payments, among others. 

That’s not to say when the pandemic is over, the services segment would drop. In fact, before the pandemic, services have already recorded strong growth. Wearables such as AirPods and Apple Watch have also recorded strong growth. They could see a higher number of unit sales in the next quarter.

The pandemic only served as a catalyst to boost AAPL stock higher when the hardware sales were recording slower growth. As a matter of fact, the pandemic actually played to Apple’s strengths. The company saw Apple Pay, Apple Music, and Apple TV+ and the App Store all performing better during the lockdown. 

## Is Apple Stock To Buy?

Apple is likely to see increasing retail demand for AAPL stock after the stock split. The company is able to leverage its massive user base to drive strong growth in its services and wearables segment. The highly anticipated first 5G iPhone will likely whet the appetite of iPhone stalwarts globally. These are some of the few areas investors might want to pay attention to see if AAPL can reach the $3 trillion mark in the near to medium term. With all these in mind, is it any surprise to say that Apple is still one of the [best tech stocks to buy](https://stockmarket.com/investing/looking-for-best-tech-stocks-to-buy-2-to-watch-right-now-2020-07-16)?",AAPL,apple hit 2 trillion market cap aapl stock still buy x200b apple hit incredible milestone may guessed yes became first tech stockhttpwwwstockmarketcominvestingtechstocks pas 2 trillion mark come ahead 4for1 stock split lower entry barrier prospective investor buy share iphone maker beaten tech giant amazon microsoft reach milestone course largely symbolic figure ’ nothing significant changing fundamentally bottom line apple well maybe like many investor contemplating whether buy aapl stock nowhttpsstockmarketcomfeaturedapplehereshowitcouldimpactyourinvestments20200813 let ’ take closer look ’ ahead iphone maker growth stay ongoing transition 5g network give aapl stock boost one key driver apple stock growth would nextgeneration 5g mobile technology technology analyst dan ives wedbush said “ apple ‘ decade ’ opportunity next 12 18 month estimate roughly 350 million cupertino ’ 950 million iphones worldwide window upgrade opportunity ” many expert believe new 5g iphone would gamechanger defining chapter world ’ largest tech company apple slated launch iphone 12 october question important iphone 12 apple ives said wedbush belief many wall street “ underestimating massive pentup demand around super cycle apple remains opportunity bull ” apple service wearable segment continues outperform even though novel coronavirus continues persist second quarter apple able generate growth revenue increased 1 fiscal third quarter apple produced record revenue 11 year year earnings per share grew 18 came amid strong performance among tech company investor certainly piling tech company benefited stayathome order include company product service related remote work cloud computing music video streaming digital payment among others ’ say pandemic service segment would drop fact pandemic service already recorded strong growth wearable airpods apple watch also recorded strong growth could see higher number unit sale next quarter pandemic served catalyst boost aapl stock higher hardware sale recording slower growth matter fact pandemic actually played apple ’ strength company saw apple pay apple music apple tv app store performing better lockdown apple stock buy apple likely see increasing retail demand aapl stock stock split company able leverage massive user base drive strong growth service wearable segment highly anticipated first 5g iphone likely whet appetite iphone stalwart globally area investor might want pay attention see aapl reach 3 trillion mark near medium term mind surprise say apple still one best tech stock buyhttpsstockmarketcominvestinglookingforbesttechstockstobuy2towatchrightnow20200716,Positive,0.9985

It now trades at nearly $2,100 a share.Once [the split](http://www.cnn.com/2020/08/18/investing/stock-splits-apple-tesla/index.html) goes into effect on August 31, current Tesla investors will get five shares for each one they own. That will [cut the price](http://www.cnn.com/2020/08/11/cars/tesla-stock-split/index.html) by a fifth, to almost $420 a share. The market value of Tesla, now hovering around $390 billion, will remain the same.But does Tesla deserve to trade at such a high valuation? While the [Elon Musk-led company](http://www.cnn.com/2020/08/18/success/elon-musk-tesla-ipo-vault-interview/index.html) is generating [consistent profits](http://www.cnn.com/2020/07/22/cars/tesla-earnings-q2/index.html), its sales are dwarfed by the major auto giants.Tesla is expected to generate nearly $30 billion in annual revenue this year. That’s nothing to sneeze at. But Fiat Chrysler ([FCAU](https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=FCAU&source=story_quote_link)) is estimated to report $100 billion in sales for 2020. GM ([GM](https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=GM&source=story_quote_link)) and Ford ([F](https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=F&source=story_quote_link)) are each forecast to post annual revenue of more than $110 billion.Still, Tesla’s market value is now more than four times the combined market caps of Detroit’s Big 3.

A majority of Wall Street analysts are betting against Tesla. Of the 33 that officially track the stock, only eight have a buy rating on Tesla while 15 have it rated a hold and 10 are recommending a sell on it.Only three of the Tesla analysts currently have a price target for it above $2,000. The consensus target is just under $1,300 — almost 40% below its current price.Tesla continues to be a [big target of short sellers](http://www.cnn.com/2020/01/30/investing/short-selling-squeeze/index.html), investors who borrow the stock and sell it with the hopes of eventually buying it back at a lower price.Of course, Tesla fans can correctly point out that analysts have been consistently wrong and that Wall Street will eventually have to raise its earnings forecasts and price targets on the stock.Tesla may also get a further boost if it is [finally added](http://www.cnn.com/2020/02/06/investing/tesla-sp-500/index.html) to the blue-chip [S&P 500 index](https://money.cnn.com/data/markets/sandp/) — a move that could soon happen now that the company has posted a consistent run of profitable quarters.

## How AAPL's 4-for-1 stock split can affect your account

Apple Inc. (AAPL) recently announced a 4-for-1 stock split. The split takes effect on August 31 for shareholders of record on Aug. 24. The stock split happens automatically in your account and you are not required to do anything. TD Ameritrade does not charge a fee for this type of a stock split.

If you own shares of AAPL before market open on Aug. 31 you will own four shares for every one you hold, and the stock price will be reduced to one-fourth of its value at the start of trading on Aug. 31. For example, if you hold 100 shares of AAPL trading at $400 per share, after the split you will own 400 shares valued at $100 per share. Likewise, if you own one options call with a strike price of $400, after the split you would own four contracts controlling 100 shares each, at a $100 strike price.

If you sell AAPL shares after Aug. 24 but before Aug. 31, you will sell them at the pre-split price. You will not be entitled to the split shares. For example: If on the last business day of trading AAPL, Aug. 28, you sell 300 shares for a pre-split market price of $400 per share, you will receive $120,000. You will not receive any split shares.

If you buy shares after Aug. 24 but before Aug. 31, you will purchase shares at the pre-split price. Following the split, you will receive the additional shares resulting from the stock split. For example: If on Aug. 26 you buy 100 shares (and hold them through the open on Aug. 31) at $400 per share, you will pay $40,000. You will receive 300 additional shares after the stock split, and the price will be reduced to the post-split price.

## How TSLA’s 5-for-1 stock split can affect your account

Tesla Inc. (TSLA) recently announced a 5-for-1 stock split. The split takes effect on August 31 for each shareholder of record on Aug. 21. The stock split happens automatically in your account and you are not required to do anything. TD Ameritrade does not charge a fee for this type of a stock split.

If you own shares of TSLA before the market open on Aug. 31 you will own five shares for every one you hold, and the stock price will be reduced to one-fifth of its value at the start of trading on Aug. 31. For example, if you hold 100 shares of TSLA trading at $1,500 per share, after the split you will own 500 shares valued at $300 per share. Likewise, if you own 1 options call controlling 100 shares with a strike price of $1,500, after the split you would own 5 contracts and control 500 shares at a $300 strike price.

If you sell TSLA shares after the record date of Aug. 21 for TSLA but before Aug. 31, you will sell them at the pre-split price. You will not be entitled to the split shares. For example: If on the last business day of trading TSLA, Aug. 28 you sell 100 TSLA shares for a pre-split market price of $1,500 per share you will receive $150,000. You will not receive any split shares.

If you buy TSLA shares after the record dates but before Aug. 31, you will purchase shares at the pre-split price. Following the split, you will receive the additional shares resulting from the stock split. For example: If on Aug. 26 you buy 100 shares (and hold them through the open on Aug. 31) at $1,500 per share, you will pay $150,000. You will receive 400 additional shares after the stock split, and the price will be reduced to the post-split price.",AAPL,here aug 31 aapl tsla stock split work alright robinhood autist here detail real brokerage split work since didnt understand shareholder record looked far tellit doesnt matter tsla sept4 2300c aapl sept20 600c x200b httpswwwtdameritradecominvestmentproductstradestocksaapltslaappleteslastocksplits2020pagehttpswwwtdameritradecominvestmentproductstradestocksaapltslaappleteslastocksplits2020page aapls 4for1 stock split affect account apple inc aapl recently announced 4for1 stock split split take effect august 31 shareholder record aug 24 stock split happens automatically account required anything td ameritrade charge fee type stock split share aapl market open aug 31 four share every one hold stock price reduced onefourth value start trading aug 31 example hold 100 share aapl trading 400 per share split 400 share valued 100 per share likewise one option call strike price 400 split would four contract controlling 100 share 100 strike price sell aapl share aug 24 aug 31 sell presplit price entitled split share example last business day trading aapl aug 28 sell 300 share presplit market price 400 per share receive 120000 receive split share buy share aug 24 aug 31 purchase share presplit price following split receive additional share resulting stock split example aug 26 buy 100 share hold open aug 31 400 per share pay 40000 receive 300 additional share stock split price reduced postsplit price tsla ’ 5for1 stock split affect account tesla inc tsla recently announced 5for1 stock split split take effect august 31 shareholder record aug 21 stock split happens automatically account required anything td ameritrade charge fee type stock split share tsla market open aug 31 five share every one hold stock price reduced onefifth value start trading aug 31 example hold 100 share tsla trading 1500 per share split 500 share valued 300 per share likewise 1 option call controlling 100 share strike price 1500 split would 5 contract control 500 share 300 strike price sell tsla share record date aug 21 tsla aug 31 sell presplit price entitled split share example last business day trading tsla aug 28 sell 100 tsla share presplit market price 1500 per share receive 150000 receive split share buy tsla share record date aug 31 purchase share presplit price following split receive additional share resulting stock split example aug 26 buy 100 share hold open aug 31 1500 per share pay 150000 receive 400 additional share stock split price reduced postsplit price,Positive,0.9985

1245,1245,2020-08-23,"Oil stocks - the time is now Hello there

I posted about [6 weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/hn9ydm/defense_stocks_what_the_heck_is_going_on/) about defense being undervalued and they’ve climbed 15-20% since then (besides HII which completely whiffed earnings). Hope you hopped on. Now I am now starting to see value in the oil sector(s). The June high and subsequent re-crash for oil industry coincided directly with the new covid case rate picking up. With covid cases declining and oil stocks generally trading in ranges for over a month now, I present my case for a break in those ranges

There are a couple of tailwinds that are happening right now for WTI:

* New covid cases in the US have dropped substantially from their peak and are on a downtrend [according to JHU’s data](https://i.imgur.com/EShb2sU.jpg). Globally, it seems to be seesawing in a confined range
* [China is buying a large amount of US crude by September](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china-oil-exclusive/exclusive-china-ramps-up-u-s-oil-purchases-ahead-of-trade-deal-review-sources-idUSKCN25A2F4), potentially 37 million barrels [according to this](https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/China-Charters-Tankers-For-37-Million-Barrels-Of-US-Oil.html)
* After flooding the US market with [Saudi oil](https://www.npr.org/2020/05/04/850026351/saudi-arabias-oil-tanker-flotilla-is-reaching-the-u-s-despite-some-objections#:~:text=Live%20Sessions-,Saudi%20Arabia's%20Oil%20Tanker%20Flotilla%20Is%20Reaching%20The%20U.S.%2C%20Despite,are%20headed%20to%20the%20U.S.), they have now cut exports to a [record low ](https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Saudi-Arabias-Crude-Oil-Exports-Dip-To-Record-Low-In-June.html)
* The dual storms in the Gulf have caused a lot of [shut-ins](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-storms-energy/oil-firms-evacuate-staff-curb-offshore-production-ahead-of-twin-storms-idUSKBN25I0J3)
* After stalling in July, air traffic is starting to [pick back up](https://www.tsa.gov/coronavirus/passenger-throughput) and routes are being added again, although still way way down

Which all support WTI prices in the coming weeks. Should be noted that rig counts have continued to lows, however last week was the first week in a long time that a few rigs came back online, which will add to the inventory. How much, I am not sure. You can see from [Baker Hughes’ rig count]( https://rigcount.bakerhughes.com/rig-count-overview) that we added 10 rigs, but are still down a net of 662 rigs from last year. Next we can take a look at the [EIA data](https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/supply/weekly/) for some more insight into what current inventories are like:

* 512M barrels of crude, 15% above average. Peak was 540M barrels on June 19th
* 244M barrels of gasoline, 7% above average. Peak was before covid due to build over the winter
* 178M barrels of distillates, 24% above average. Peak was 180M barrels on July 31st
* Refinery inputs at 14.5M barrels, low was 12.4M barrels on May 13th 
* Refinery rates at 81%. At the low on April 22nd it was at 67%, normally around 95%.
* WTI is trading in the $42-43 range, with the low being negative due to the contract rollover situation back in the Spring

The last several EIA reports have been good in general – drawing down of products, with two weeks in a row of fantastic gasoline draw down. 

What’s my point here? The takeaway should be this: the worst is over and it seems we're about halfway recovered. Now is the best chance for a while to get beaten up value stocks at a discount, as the industry recovers and conditions for the crash are resolving

Right now cyclicals have been beaten down to Earth’s core as tech goes up and up. Cyclicals and value generally outperform in a market recovery and I expect a rotation at some point, strengthened by a combination of inventory drops making headlines, covid cases going down, and a general resumption of normal. Any stimulus would be big news for these beaten down stocks as well

Worried about a Democratic administration? Unlike the defense stocks I had previously looked at, I think it’s a real issue for this industry. The Democratic platform calls out removing tax breaks for oil and gas companies while adding environmental regulations. It’s weird that big tech has been climbing – companies like Amazon, Apple, Facebook etc. that are known tax avoiders and privacy usurpers seem like prime candidates to have a ‘tax bill fear’ from the Dem’s closing of tax avoidance legislation and future lawsuits. I haven’t seen any hints of this in the market, so I am going to assume this is not considered a big deal by investors. Environmental regulations should be, however

However, I still believe these low valuations are still too low, even with headwinds. Some of the majors have already been adjusting (Shell in particular) and refineries like Valero already have strong renewable fuels segments; Phillips 66 recently announced plans to build the [biggest renewable diesel refinery in the world](https://investor.phillips66.com/financial-information/news-releases/news-release-details/2020/Phillips-66-Plans-to-Transform-San-Francisco-Refinery-into-Worlds-Largest-Renewable-Fuels-Plant/default.aspx)

What am I looking at in particular?

Right now, refineries have the best value to me. PSX is **criminally** undervalued with a safe dividend. VLO is another that is set for strong performance. MPC has a strong position after its Speedway asset sale, but I would rank PSX>VLO>MPC at this point for value.

* PSX target price: ~$82, sitting currently at ~$61
* VLO target price: ~$71-72, sitting currently at ~$52.50

From a producer standpoint, CVX and COP are both fundamentally solid (I prefer COP at this point). RDS is the closest its been to it’s covid low and is one of the leading majors in transitioning off oil. It’s been beaten down since losing its dividend but I can only assume it will be back. I’m not a fan of XOM going forward, but right now it’s at the low of the range it’s been confined in and wouldn’t be a bad temporary pickup. FANG / EOG / PXD aren’t bad pickups either

1248,1248,2020-08-24,"We made an automatic stock screener and portfolio tracker to help making decisions Hey everyone, my friend and I are very into stocks. We have created spreadsheets to screen stocks and track our portfolios. We spent weekends working on automating them and making them usable for everyone here (inspired by u/mau2509’s awesome spreadsheet - thanks for sharing here!).

Here is the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AIC22xJtitg8leYTOsIYUBXgzIBAm6gAi8EccViEGrY/edit#gid=0)

You can go to *“File” > “Make a copy”* to save it. *Gray cells are the ones that take user input*, all other ones are automatically filled out.

There are 3 tables in the spreadsheet (all in “Main” sheet):

1. **“Purchased”**: enter the stock tickers you own with the number of shares. This helps you look at the total value of your position in a stock, total portfolio value and how much % is in each stock (useful for Rate My Portfolio).
2. **“Investment Tracker”**: enter your desired % allocation for each category (US stocks, International Stocks, Bonds) if you don’t like the default values. We find this useful to take into consideration how diversified our portfolio is before making buy/sell decisions, so that our portfolio is more robust to downturns specific to a certain category.
3. **“Decision Making”**: enter any stock ticker you’re screening to buy/sell. It will automatically fill out several metrics: current price; category and sector; total return over 1, 3, 5, 10 years; recommendation; 30-day trend; current, average and maximum P/E ratio (w/ % of how far the current value is from the average and from max); VWAP; RSI; current and forecasted EPS.

We added comments to explain most metrics and color-coded based on our subjective opinions on what numbers are good/bad for buying decisions (green for good, red for bad, yellow for neutral). You can also use this sheet for selling decisions with different conditions.

The “**Decision Making**” table can be used independently of the other ones for stock screening.

We hope this is helpful!

1249,1249,2020-08-24,"AAPL long term Gooooood morning crayon-munching community.        
With the AAPL run up last week, the meme power, the white bitches breaking and buying more iPhones power, I had an interesting thought.
        
So Timmy and the boys at A.P.P.L.E. (All People Purchase Largeamountsofour Electronics) continue to surge past rough meetings (the tech CEO hearing) and lawsuits (Epic Games, although I guess that’s not over yet so who knows what’s coming this week).  
       
My point is: Apple isn’t dying anytime soon.  There are many things I hate about apple products and their business model; but guess what I’m typing this post on.  An __iphone 7.__  It’s the simple fact that Apple had the first intriguing and attractive display on a functioning smart phone, and I guarantee you 90% of people with iPhones would switch to a non-Apple phone if the account switching and device learning weren’t such a hassle.  On top of that, iOS is generally more attractive to the eye.   And on top of *that,* all the braindeads with Apple devices wouldn’t switch to such a shit on community of devices.  How many times have you seen that dumbass tweet “if the text don’t come in blue, I ain’t wanna talk to you🤧” or something along the lines of shaming androids and calling them broke boys?  
It’s just a fact that Apple will not die, and they will continue to grow long term with the assortment of powers Apple has.
        
So here was my thought;
Apple is guaranteed to continue growing in the next couple years; aside from apple making a disgustingly bad move and ruining the Apple Inc. name, the risk in writing off puts between $400-$500 and opening spreads a bit higher is almost zero.  
       
Open a 540/580 credit put spread for 9/16/2022, receive $2710 in premium INSTANTLY, and watch as both contracts get passed up by apples sprinting share price in Naruto-like fashion, and become crumbled remains within the next year (when apple shoots up to 600+ in 12 months time).
      
Giving Apple a 20% growth from now could be too generous, it could be lowballing the fuck out of it.  
Regardless, Apple won’t be trading below 550 next year.
       
I’m not saying go all in and go full stupid mode (this is WSB I know where I am and what I’m doing i ***SWEAR***) but I can’t see how writing a couple 400 puts, a 450 or two, and maybe a 500 and then opening some CPspreads could fuck me.  If Tim loses his touch and Apple crashes into the mud, then obviously I’d be in for quite a mess...
But set instant alerts for apples stock price and news and watch out for nukes to the stock price 
     
I’d **love** to hear what you lot have to say.

1257,1257,2020-08-27,"Tesla Is Now Worth $400 Billion The world’s most valuable car company just hit another milestone.

Tesla ￼’s (ticker: TSLA) market capitalization on Wednesday topped $400 billion. About two months ago, it was celebrating $200 billion. It first hit $100 billion in January.

Tesla passed Johnson & Johnson ￼ (JNJ) along the way on Wednesday, in terms of market cap. There are only seven companies in the S&P 500 index worth more, including Visa ￼ (V) at $447 billon and Apple ￼ (AAPL) at $2.16 trillion.

There is a lot you could buy for $400 billion. Here are a few notable   comparisons to put that figure in context.

It’s more than the combined value of every team in the four major U.S. professional sports, according to Forbes estimates. It’s also more than the Forbes estimate for the combined net worth of Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, and Tesla’s own CEO Elon Musk.

It’s nearly four times International Business Machines ￼’ (IBM) market cap.

You could buy 400 billion things at a dollar store—or just buy Dollar General ￼ (DG) and Dollar Tree ￼ (DLTR).

It’s also more than the individual gross domestic product of Israel, Ireland, and Hong Kong.

With $400 billion, you could also stockpile about 181 billion regular gallons of gas, based on AAA’s U.S. estimates. You could drive 5.79 trillion miles, if you averaged 32 miles per gallon. That would take you around the Earth 232.5 million times.

If you are into electric vehicles, $400 billion could get you 10.53 million of Tesla’s basic 2020 Model 3. Of course, such a sale would cause price targets to soar. And Tesla would need a few more factories to turn out that many vehicles. The company only delivered about 90,000 vehicles in the second quarter.

Stocks ended a choppy session on a mixed note, with major benchmarks showing a slowdown in the record-breaking rally. Investors focus on this week’s unemployment data and Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s promise to nudge inflation higher

The NASDAQ snapped its win streak, ending 0.17% down on the day. The S&P ended 0.28% up and the Dow snapped its losing streak to end the day 0.62%.

In today’s Jackson Hole speech, Jerome Powell unveiled the Feds new framework that will tolerate inflation ‘moderately above 2% target’ and committed to reviewing this policy every five years. Powell warned that ‘persistence of low inflation over the last eight years risks new economic difficulties.”

Meanwhile, Microsoft ($MSFT) and Walmart ($WMT) got a boost as reports surfaced that the two giants were nearing a joint agreement to buy out TikTok. CNBC reported that the retail giant had joined in with Microsoft to buy the platform, in the wake of TikTok’s CEO resigning. A deal could close as soon as this week, CNBC reported.

The impact of the coronavirus pandemic continues to reverberate across the economy, with the report showing back-to-back weeks that jobless claims topped the 1 million mark, following a brief break below that level earlier in August.

**Highlights**

* Microsoft reached an all-time high at $231.15, finishing the session 2.46% up.

1266,1266,2020-08-28,"With MSFT, AAPL AMZN, GOOGL and FB making up more than 1/5 of the S&P500, what are practical ways to de-risk your portfolio from this imbalance? For those who subscribe to having the majority or the entirety of their equity holdings to consist of ETF/funds from the S&P 500, the impact to their portfolio as a function of any one company has increased substantially.

Even with total market funds like Vanguard's VTI, these five stocks make up an outsized portion of the fund because of market cap weight.  

Much like investors using ""ex-US"" funds to increase exposure to international holdings, are there funds that are ""ex-FAANG"" so individuals can lessen the impact?  If not, would another practical strategy be to buy more non-tech sector funds as opposed to say buy more of the 400+ other S&P 500 stocks as counterweight.

Thoughts?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**EDIT1:**  /u/exaggerate_a_point summed up my ask better than my own attempt so I'll add it here instead of responding to similar comments:

> OP specifically said he/she wants to de-risk, aka diversify. It's not about not holding good companies, it's about hedging the risk if one has a bad series of news or events. It's inherently risky if your portfolio is heavily weighted in a handful of companies.

Another good summary of the ask for this discussion from /u/FerociousGiraffe :

>Trying to move your portfolio away from FAANG isn’t to say those are great, successful, hugely profitable companies. You’d keep a position in them. It’s about protecting against news that will only hurt FAANG while not hurting the broader market.

**EDIT2:**  For comments related to balancing with international equities, this discussion is contained for U.S. equities.  Assume whatever percentage of bonds, precious metals, digital currency, international equities or whatever you think is appropriate in a portfolio has been addressed.

**EDIT3:**  Outside of suggestions like ""Why do you hate winning?"", some of the top solutions to dilute these stocks from your S&P 500 / U.S. equities part of a portfolio:

* Many suggest a variation of my original post of simply adding more sector funds outside of tech.  Though this strategy will unfortunately remove many non-giant tech companies in this sector.

* Many of you like /u/desquibnt suggests equal weighted ETFs like RSP.  However, RSP has a high net expense ratio of 0.20%.  

* /u/TriathlonNerd suggests a reverse cap weighted ETF like RVRS.  This too has a high net expense ratio of 0.29%.

* /u/BubbyginkESO and others suggests going broader than just 500 companies with low cost total market funds like Vanguard's VTI or Fidelity's FZROX.  While these 5 stocks still make up the top holdings, the effect of a larger basket of stocks also dilutes these companies.

This is going to be the most important positive change for Apple ever since I started. You literally have no idea. 

— The iPhone 12 is getting released with the A14 chip that will be so much more powerful than the Qualcomm chip in android phones that they won’t be able to catch up for years. (The new 865 plus is hardly faster than last year’s overpriced 865) 

— this will be achieved by using TSMC’s brand new 5nm technology which is gonna be more powerful and more power efficient than people are expecting. 

— TSMC is already working on their 3nm tech that will be going into 2022 iPhones, iPads and Macs. 

— they are gonna implement 5G across their iPhone lineup without raising the prices crazy high like other brands like Samsung are forced to do right now. 

— leaks have shown that the iPhone 12 pro will come with the widely requested 120Hz display and insane camera recording features (4K at 240fps) 

— their Apple silicon chip Macs are gonna be so good and so powerful using TSMC’s 5nm tech that people’s minds will be blown. The new features and battery life are gonna be game changers. 

— the transition period to ARM-based chips will be much smoother than people are expecting. 

— these Macs will likely also have models with support for 5G cellular. 

— their new iPads are gonna start getting redesigned with a modern design for the first time in years. While the android tablets aren’t getting much better. Huge demand upswing. 

— the Apple Watch is gonna support more sensors and features than ever before, and they’re gonna release a brand new budget model for the first time. 

— Apple is gonna release their brand new services bundles which are gonna be very popular, and we all know that services are where the money is at. 

— Apple is gonna release a new Apple TV which will begin to get marketed as a gaming console. They’ll release a new gaming controller at the same time that will work across all of their Apple devices including the iPhone. 

— Apple will release a HomePod mini to better compete with the Amazon echo and push their Apple Music sales. 

— Apple is gonna begin to switch most of their devices to Mini-LED displays on their devices which will be almost as good as OLED without all of the drawbacks. 

— The stock split is gonna allow a bunch of new investors to get in after they realize all of this is happening.

1272,1272,2020-08-29,"TikTok will cease to exist in a year in the US if Microsoft/Walmart buy it Maybe thats the real goal  though? I mean you basically have the two uncoolest companies on the planet looking to acquire it. Remember Mixer? What a piece of garbage that was. Remember the xbox 360 E3? ""Tv tv tv tv sports tv tv tv sports call of duty tv tv xbox is the next water cooler"" and then Sony whipped the shit out of them.

When you think of Walmart you picture some old overweight redneck in their pajamas buying cheap processed garbage food surrounded by workers who get paid like a third of a living wage. 

Young people are already looking at alternatives to Tik Tok.


Im sure Microsoft will pay Usher, Bob Dole, and Nickelback to try and hype up their purchase, lol. 


And there are only two ways they make a profit off TikTok. One involves spying on people like Facebook which I guess is only cool if America does it but not any other country? The other is they throw a billion ads at people. Im sure people will love sitting through a 15 second laxative commercial so they can watch a 10 second video clip. 

There is also the issue these companies might think having some high school chick dance in her bikini is inapproptiate but Id wager TikTok is mostly those girls and their young male peers thirsting. 
Here is another issue. Every record company and musical artist might want some royalties paid everytime their music is used, little easier to do when it is two American companies 
Microsoft/Walmart will probably turn tik tok into some Boomer thing where people make video clips of themselves doing taxes or planting stuff in their yard or making it twitter but talking in front of a camera.



Yes, there is potential for these companies to be involved with important demographics that they have little to do with otherwise...theres bigger potential they will spend tens of billions only to watch the users flee it like rats on a sinking ship and then closing it while everyone just moves onto the next fad.

* The average pleb thinks they've gotten enough tendies from Papa Musk and Tim Apple. They sell it all to lock in gains. Also, that's the 3rd eviction notice and they finally have to pay rent. They cash out.
* Fractional shares already exist for those who wanted cheap AAPL and TSLA. There is no need for the college kids to buy due to lower price.
* Broke af people with just 1 share see an opportunity for liquidity. Before the split, on the one hand, they wanted to lock in gains and on the other hand they didn't want to sell their only share of their biggest winner. Now they can sell part of their position.
* People are expecting them to drop, because they are overextended and we are in a dot com bubble. They sell in order to ""buy the dip"".
* Retard algos auto trigger from unusual activity and sell hard.
* Big dogs are expecting the dip and sell at open driving everything down even further.

Why? because of things like this:

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-taps-market-rally-keg-145407552.html

Tesla did the same thing back in February, almost immediately after the stock hit $1000/share, and then priced the offering at $767 to raise $2 billion. A few months before that people were afraid they were going to have to file bankruptcy, but with that offering they rescued themselves and gleaned the cash they needed to keep going. Now, after a 5:1 split and another MASSIVE run to pre-split prices of almost $2.5k, ol musky boy files a $5 billion shelf which basically means they can now sell up to 5 billion in shares whenever they want. You better believe that a big chunk of this will be sold in the near future, and they will raise billions in cash at these ridiculous valuations.

I briefly talked yesterday about Tesla's market cap and how it was absurdly priced and honestly felt like gambling to me. However, APPL is somewhat overlooked as well and I wanted to hear your guys' thoughts on it!

Apple's Market Cap as of right now is 2.3 Trillion ([Source](https://ycharts.com/companies/AAPL/market_cap)). On August 20, it was 2 Trillion. It has added 300 billion in about 10 days - without having added any products what soever (primarily due to the stock split).

In April of this year, it was 1.1 Trillion or so. It has since doubled since that time, so much so that it is the size of the GDP of France ([https://www.statista.com/statistics/685925/gdp-of-european-countries/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/685925/gdp-of-european-countries/))

Now, I am all for Apple devices and services. They make some of the best products ever. They have crazy high margins and once a consumer buys an Apple device, he has to buy other ones due to the seamless integration it provides (biggest selling point). It is now getting in more markets such as India with its' new iPhone SE 2, but I am somewhat skeptical on its' valuation.

I feel like people are buying AAPL due to its security - it has always gone up, so it will always go up - and therefore, it's safe to park their money there. Some are even likening it to Treasury Bonds - that it's better to put your money in AAPL stock because it's *safe* and because it's so big, it won't fail. 

I wanted to know if AAPL is overvalued/overpriced or not? I know the first 5G iPhone is coming out and it will have an impact but still, are people putting too much blind trust/faith in AAPL?

""When we look at Tesla in our simple two-stage model to try to understand embedded expectations (using a 7% discount rate, 4% terminal growth rate) to justify current levels (never mind future appreciation), Tesla would need to grow FCF at a \~36% CAGR for 10-yrs.""

And in a computer simulation, laws of physics and finance in the real world need not apply. The last few months of TSLA trading have defied two conventional stock market rules of thumb – that SP500 index inclusion is worth \~5-15% and that share splits are value-neutral. And with a potential SP500 index rebalancing in September, and Battery Day on Sept. 22nd the stock price momentum may continue. While we noted after 2Q that when Stripping out reg credits and made-in-China revenue to focus on ‘same store’ Fremont factory sales undercuts the growth narrative that has propelled the stock, we are not holding our breath for the market to take note as the bull narrative continues to be that TSLA will dominate EVs, Energy and robotaxis. And this narrative will likely allow TSLA to finance expansion –leading us to raise our PT (split adjusted) but we retain our UW – and we’re still not clear on when momentum breaks.""

**Goldman (Neutral rating, $295 price target) comments on today's announcement of $5bn equity raise:**

""We believe key points to help contextualize this news includes:

1) $5 bn of equity issuance would represent about 1% incremental shares based on the 8/31/2020 close.

2) The prospectus states that the use of proceeds would be to further strengthen the balance sheet, and for general corporate purposes.

3) Tesla has a history of issuing equity, but unlike this proposed offering Tesla has typically announced offerings on the day it filed or within a few weeks of filing its 10-Q/10-K. Further, while the company commented on its 4Q19 EPS call that it was not capital constrained, investing as fast as it sensibly could and generating positive cash flow, Tesla has also raised capital post making those comments (the company last issued new equity in February 2020). Finally, the company has capacity expansion plans underway at several factories, and per its last 10-K Tesla expects average annual capex to be $2.5-$3.5 bn from 2020-2022.

We therefore consider the news to be somewhat of a surprise especially related to the timing, but not a shock given Tesla's history of equity raises and its future expansion plans.""",TSLA,tsla analyst continues hate itbut wrong stock thus far rbc underperform rating 290 price target many tesla operation company ’ quality service believe average must improve else risking brand – especially competition coming struggle explain runup stock split academically ’ change value tesla equity could help fuel retail investor interest still view tesla fundamentally overvalued grow valuation look tesla simple twostage model try understand embedded expectation using 7 discount rate 4 terminal growth rate justify current level never mind future appreciation tesla would need grow fcf 36 cagr 10yrs barclays underweight rating 125 price target elon musk proponent science fiction theme world know simulation – one big computer video game computer simulation law physic finance real world need apply last month tsla trading defied two conventional stock market rule thumb – sp500 index inclusion worth 515 share split valueneutral potential sp500 index rebalancing september battery day sept 22nd stock price momentum may continue noted 2q stripping reg credit madeinchina revenue focus ‘ store ’ fremont factory sale undercut growth narrative propelled stock holding breath market take note bull narrative continues tsla dominate ev energy robotaxis narrative likely allow tsla finance expansion –leading u raise pt split adjusted retain uw – ’ still clear momentum break goldman neutral rating 295 price target comment today announcement 5bn equity raise believe key point help contextualize news includes 1 5 bn equity issuance would represent 1 incremental share based 8312020 close 2 prospectus state use proceeds would strengthen balance sheet general corporate purpose 3 tesla history issuing equity unlike proposed offering tesla typically announced offering day filed within week filing 10q10k company commented 4q19 eps call capital constrained investing fast sensibly could generating positive cash flow tesla also raised capital post making comment company last issued new equity february 2020 finally company capacity expansion plan underway several factory per last 10k tesla expects average annual capex 2535 bn 20202022 therefore consider news somewhat surprise especially related timing shock given tesla history equity raise future expansion plan,Positive,0.9885

1293,1293,2020-09-02,"The pros are getting ready for a market crash — retail investors, not so much, top economist warns ***‘A large market correction, should one materialise, would encourage more professional selling that could overwhelm the buy-the-dip retail investor.’***

That’s **Mohamed El-Erian, Allianz’s chief economic adviser**, explaining in [an op-ed for the Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/e50812f0-51c1-4f8c-9072-21eb0eb8cb9d) how action in the options pits should be taken as a warning by retail investors who have been cashing in on the stock market’s relentless push higher in recent months.

“The seemingly endless rally… gives the impression that prices are endorsed and supported by the entire professional investment community,” he said. “After all, despite the vocal concerns over valuations having split away from underlying corporate and economic fundamentals, few fund managers have been willing to challenge the market by placing outright shorts. “

However, “sophisticated investors” are expressing their cautious views with the use of derivatives, and El-Erian says the mom-and-pop types should take note.

“It is hard to overstate the extent of today’s risk-taking in U.S. financial markets,” he wrote, pointing to the explosive moves in a small number of high-flyers, such as Apple [**AAPL,** **+3.98%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/AAPL?mod=MW_story_quote), Tesla [**TSLA,** **-4.67%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/TSLA?mod=MW_story_quote) and Amazon [**AMZN,** **+1.39%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/AMZN?mod=MW_story_quote).

“Much of this could be seen as market deepening were it not for one troubling fact: corporate and economic fundamentals have yet to reflect a sustained and convincing recovery from COVID-related damage,” he said. The rebound in consumption is slowing, initial jobless claims are back to the 1 million level for a second straight week, bankruptcies are rising, and, according to El-Erian, it’s looking like these short-term disruptions are about to become long-term scars.

“Rather than a well-thought-out bet on the future, stocks reflect many investors’ resolute faith in a consistently favourable and predictable liquidity environment,” he wrote. “It is a backdrop anchored by reliable stimulus from central banks.”

On the surface, the same can pretty much be said for what we’re seeing in the derivatives market, but there’s more to it than just that.

“The fear of missing out on an unceasing equity rally has increasingly been expressed through call options,” El-Erian said. “Those who would normally short the market on concerns of excessive valuations appear to have no desire to be steamrollered once again by favourable liquidity and the strong ‘buy-the-dip’ conditioning that comes with that.”

He pointed out that buying call options limits risk and gives traders the ability to take strategic shots at capturing rallies.

But more broadly, with Tesla likely to demonstrate different levers to reduce cost in battery, we expect it to lay out the case for why it can significantly reduce vehicle cost, ultimately unlocking lower vehicle ASP pricepoints (i.e., perhaps showing how Tesla can sell $25k vehicles), and thus how Tesla can significantly expand unit sales.

Plans to File Antitrust Charges Against Google in Coming Weeks [https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/03/us/politics/google-antitrust-justice-department.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/03/us/politics/google-antitrust-justice-department.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage)

Key Excerpts:

&#x200B;

>The Justice Department plans to bring an antitrust case against Google as soon as this month, after Attorney General William P. Barr overruled career lawyers who said they needed more time to build a strong case against one of the world’s wealthiest, most formidable technology companies, according to five people briefed on internal department conversations.  
>  
>Justice Department officials told lawyers involved in the antitrust inquiry into Alphabet, the parent company of Google and YouTube, to wrap up their work by the end of September, according to three of the people. Most of the 40-odd lawyers who had been working on the investigation opposed the deadline. Some said they would not sign the complaint, and several of them left the case this summer.

&#x200B;

>Brianna Herlihy, a Justice Department spokeswoman, declined to comment on the continuing investigation. Jose Castaneda, a spokesman for Google, said that the company would “continue to engage with ongoing investigations” and that its business practices enabled “increased choice and competition.”

&#x200B;

>The Justice Department amassed powerful evidence of anticompetitive practices, three people said.  
>  
>But the lawyers also described internal politics that at times slowed down the department’s work or drove a wedge among members of the team.

&#x200B;

>For nearly a year, dozens of Justice Department lawyers and other staff members worked in two groups, each overseeing a separate line of inquiry: Google’s dominance in search and its control over many aspects of the ecosystem for online advertising.

&#x200B;

>Google controls about 90 percent of web searches globally, and rivals have complained that the company extended its dominance by making its search and browsing tools defaults on phones with its Android operating system. Google also captures about one-third of every dollar spent on online advertising, and its ad tools are used to supply and auction ads that appear across the internet.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Antitrust scrutiny of Big Tech seems to have picked up with Google in the Trump Administrations crosshairs.

1304,1304,2020-09-04,"Stock market bloodbath: Dow and Nasdaq plummet in the worst day since June Thursday was the Nasdaq's largest one-day decline from a record high in its history, according to Bespoke Investment Group.

All three major indexes finished the day sharply lower. The Nasdaq closed down nearly 5%, and the S&P fell 3.5%, while the Dow finished 2.8%, or 808 points, lower.

So, what happened?

For one, the Nasdaq has been outperforming the other two major stock indexes — the Dow (INDU) and the S&P 500 (SPX) — for months. The rally has been going on for long enough that investors are now taking profit.

Even so, the Nasdaq remains up nearly 28% in 2020, still far outpacing its counterparts. The Dow, which only recently turned positive for the year, is back in the red.

""Although there is no single driver for the weakness, it seems as if investors all of a sudden realized how overbought stocks are and sold. Someone yelled fire in a crowded theater and everyone left at once,"" said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist for LPL Financial, in emailed comments.

But there are also technical reasons for Thursday's decline: As US-China relations sour, investors are moving money out of tech, which could get hit the hardest from a potential increase in tariffs.

""The Nasdaq is getting hit hard with the continued rotation into cyclicals and expectations big-tech will ultimately pay the cost to a further deterioration with US-Chinese relations,"" said Ed Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda.

Stocks in cyclical sectors are expected to perform better as the economy is recovering.

The Big Tech companies such as Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT), all of which are part of the Nasdaq, have become the safe-haven investment of the summer. But investors have beginning to wonder when the rally will run out of steam, either because of increased regulation or because the economy as a whole picks up enough to void the need for safety picks altogether.

Treatment would have required surgery costing over $12,000 for a total hip replacement which I had saved up previously from my part-time job. However, after browsing WSB, looking at famous tesla YouTubers layout their investment thesis of tesla being a $2-3 trillion-dollar company, beating the competition, autonomous vehicles and battery day I was enticed with the narrative.

It’s about the ecosystem. And nobody does it like Apple.

The number of apps and secondary Apple products they’ll sell over the next year is going to be off the charts. And with the soon to be released ARM-based MacBook that ecosystem will be stronger than ever, with even more incentive for app development and growth. And don’t forget Apple gets that juicy 30% cut.

1311,1311,2020-09-06,"TSLA the biggest pump and dump in human history Softbank put huge amounts of money on tech calls to drive up the price. I decided to find out how much this would effect the stock. There's currently about 50 billion dollars in calls on Tesla and 5 billion on puts. A call ATM has about .5 delta which means the market makers are force to delta hedge about 50 shares. The total delta hedge on Tesla should be about 77 billion which is about 20% of the market cap of 389 billion. Now 20% is significant, however Tesla has already fallen by 20% this week. 

Theres also a possibility that HFT is chasing the momentum and affecting the price. "" It is estimated that 50 percent of stock trading volume in the U.S. is currently being driven by computer-backed high frequency trading. Also known as algo or algortihmic trading. ""

Everyone knows the tech price are high. Elon sent prices into overdrive with the split. Then he announced a 5 billion dollar public offering to pay off there debt (worried about future cash issues?), which the shares will likely be priced below market value due to the volatility sending prices even lower. Elons brother sells right after the split knowing it would be ATH.

My thought process? Negative news will cause people to close there call options. TSLA won't be added to S&P. People are already anticipating high volatility during election, so large institutions will hedge with puts, causing more delta hedging of the stock downward. Market makers already have low gamma exposure, which means rather than focus on reducing volatility for long term profits, they will have to sell when others sell and buy when others buy causing increased volatility which leads to lower prices. Also the dark pool index is low meaning its becoming illiquid and a crash could cause large corporations to have to sell on the actual stock market causing huge price movements. The public offering on TSLA will likely cause the stock to creep lower as well. 

So a possible timeline: 

Tuesday: TSLA drops 2-5% due to the S&P news, as well as the insider trading news. Rest of the market is ""okay"" due to nothing unusual over the weekend.

Wednesday: Big money may pull out a bit due to the massive layoffs from airlines recently, and the knowledge of unemployment numbers on Thursday showing we are not recovering. another 3% drop in the market, 8% drop for Tesla. 

Thursday: Bloody

This is gaining more traction than I thought, so I want to point out that I'm not putting my ass on the line with naked puts on tesla.

My thinking is we are already beginning to see the fall, and there is so much leverage that the price will plummet pretty hard.

1315,1315,2020-09-08,"How have the WHALES behaved? I aggregated and summarized institutional holdings data and price performance data from some of the biggest tech names over the last 5 years *Disclaimer: I'm a geek and love data. Prepare yourselves for geekery. All data is sourced from SEC 13-F filings, and note that these figures are estimates and may differ significantly due to the recent large moves in tech stocks. For the most part the calculations should be accurate but because institutional ownership is relative to market cap, it can be skewed if there's a big change in stock price compared to the point the holdings data was reported. I've tried to ensure the market cap comparison is current, but it can still be a bit fucky due to the fact that the holdings data is from Q2 and Q3 hasn't been fully reported yet (for example TSLA market cap at the time of the 13F filings for Q2 was $200ish billion, so 97B in holdings represents 48% ownership. The value of those holdings should increase proportionately to the share price so theoretically if you extrapolate it out to today, it should be the same (96.11 million shares * 5 for the split) * 418.32 last close = $201 billion / current market cap of approx $400 billion, yadda yadda ... it's close enough). It's also possible I'm just dumb and my calculations are wrong, so take this w/ a grain of salt and please point out any errors you see! K. Onward, noble gentry.*

So for something I was working on for my personal website I wanted to create some new little code snippets that would aggregate and display various stats on price performance and institutional holdings. Watching institutional holdings has led to some interesting discoveries in the past, not the least of which is the recent one that [SoftBank basically went balls out and goosed the nasdaq like a WSB YOLO'er](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-nasdaq-whale-may-have-triggered-the-stock-markets-brutal-rout-claims-report-11599234572).

Since I just finished these little snippets to aggregate this data, I decided to put them to use and check out how institutions as a whole have behaved over the last several years. I don't know if this really provides any interesting findings, but I'll share my thoughts along the way I guess and you can all argue and tell me I'm wrong/stupid/whatever ... it's the internet - have at it. Here's what I found: 

#AAPL:

Apple's institutional holdings have been pretty static over the last five years, increasing only about 2.47% over that time period. Whales seem to pretty much stick around 58-62% ownership in AAPL. That didn't stop that ownership from increasing over half a trillion bucks in value though, increasing from a value of $425 billion in 2015 to $931 billion in 2020. Over that time, Apple's share price has appreciated 330% from $28 to $120 (split adjusted). Summary: https://i.imgur.com/JhkdjnV.png (Note that shares for institutional ownership are pre-split, so multiply the share numbers by 4 to get current holdings. The percentages don't change) What I find interesting about AAPL is that as a whole, institutions actually decreased their holdings over the last three months (by 137M shares/548M post split) and still ""made"" $276B thanks to the massive tech rally (note I say ""made"" because this isn't profit, per say, it's an increase in the value of their holdings, which obviously (hopefully? lol) they're not going to dump, but it's still interesting to me!) Ok anyway - onto the next:

#AMZN:

Amazon has seen institutions decrease their holdings about 10% over the last five years. Compared to Apple's increase of 2.47% this is a pretty drastic difference, but still the whales hold 287.43 million shares of AMZN worth almost $800 billion, or about 57.47% of the company. Over that time, the value of their holdings has appreciated over $654B despite their decreasing stake, thanks to AMZN's colossal 536.59% return over that time period. AMZN's institutional holdings also decreased over the last three months, like AAPL's, but still increased in value over $230 billion or about 41.45% over that time, compared to the price appreciation in AMZN of only 30.53%. Does that mean they ""beat"" the market? Maybe I'm misinterpreting that data but that's what it seems to suggest to me. Maybe I'm retarded, please share your thoughts there. Here's a summary: https://i.imgur.com/v9Hpccy.png

#MSFT:

Microsoft is similar to AAPL in that their institutional holdings seem to hover around the same level. It's about 70% owned by institutions and has hovered between 70-75% over the last five years. MSFT has appreciated 388% during that time, while the value of whale holdings has increased from $255B to over $1T (323%). I dunno about you guys, but my portfolio hasn't increased $824 billion in the last five years. Pretty wild. Here's a summary: https://i.imgur.com/dp4YyjW.png

#FB:

Facebook is the first one we're looking at with a significant INCREASE in institutional holdings over the last five years, as whales have increased their stake about 10.42% from 54.85% to the current 65.27%. Over that same time period, Facebook stock has appreciated 215%, taking the value of their holdings from $132B to $422B, an increase of about 219% which is pretty much in line w/ the market. Here's a summary: https://i.imgur.com/UPFiXY4.png

#NFLX:

Whales have been unloading Netflix over the last five years, down about 6% over that time period, but NFLX has by far the highest institutional ownership level of any we've looked at so far, at over 80% of the company valued at $161 billion. Over the last five years the value of these holdings has increased from $34 billion to $161 billion, an increase of 373% vs the stock's appreciation of 443.5%. Summary: https://i.imgur.com/CFX0Bmw.png

#GOOGL:

Google is another pretty boring one IMO. It's about 66% owned by whales, a level which has stayed pretty static over the last five years. It's only dropped about 2.5% over that time. Institutions seem to be pretty chill holding onto GOOGL and just maintaining their investment. Over that time the value of these holdings has gone from $251B to $637B as the stock increased 145% from $643 to its current price. Here's the summary: https://i.imgur.com/gd9t0nS.png

And last but not least ... 

#TSLA:

I found this one the most interesting (I mean really what did we expect lol). Over the last five years institutions have decreased their stake by 13.75%, and 8.56% of that was in the last 12 months. Total institutional ownership right now hovers around 48%, which is worth about $97 billion (96 million pre-split shares, so about 500 million now). What I find most interesting about TSLA is that even though institutional ownership has decreased about 2% in the last three months, as a whole, institutions added about 2.53 million TSLA shares which means the reason that their percentage has decreased is related to the change in TSLA's market cap. I'm not an expert but I suspect this has something to do with the retard-strength rally of 120% over the last 3 months, or maybe the fact that TSLA has gone from a split-adjusted $49 to $418, a whopping 742% increase over the last five years. Here's the summary for that: https://i.imgur.com/Isjf9Gl.png

Alright that's enough for now. I'll do more of these if people like them. Like I said I don't know if this really yields any interesting info but my takeaways from it are pretty straightforward:

1) Whales are unloading TSLA, AMZN, and NFLX on average over the last 5 years, but they own a ton of NFLX relative to the others I looked at

2) Whales are loading the boat on FB. Long FB calls or somethin, I dunno

3) Whales are pretty static on GOOGL, AAPL and MSFT.

1316,1316,2020-09-08,"Losses of Apple, Amazon and Facebook bring down stock market  

US stocks fell to their lowest level in two weeks, with the shares of major technology companies under pressure for the second day, due to concerns that valuations were too high for this year's performance.

The declines of Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook pushed the Nasdaq 100, the index of the 100 largest non-financial companies, down more than 5%, although it reduced those losses by more than half as the day progressed and investors found bargains. The broader market fared better, with the S&P 500 index dropping just over 1% in the afternoon.

US Treasury yields increased while the dollar remained stable. Oil dropped to less than $ 40 a barrel for the first time in a month.

According to Bloomberg, Friday's biggest sales appeared to stem from concerns that the recent surge in technology stocks was not linked to broad investor sentiment, but instead would have been driven by overseas options trading. a company.

The Financial Times reported that SoftBank bought billions of dollars in technology derivatives before the crash that started Thursday.

Traders are looking to find an appropriate valuation for technology stocks and assess the health of the US economy as the coronavirus pandemic progresses after killing more than 180,000 Americans.

While the tech industry is generating huge profits during lockdowns, there is also evidence that high-profile companies are overbought.

Elsewhere, emerging market stocks fell for the third day. European stocks plunged. Asian stocks fell, with the Australian index registering the biggest drop since May. Meanwhile, the Ibovespa faced declines of more than 3%, and risks losing 100,000 points again.

1319,1319,2020-09-08,"Tesla, snubbed by the S&P 500, quickly completes $5 billion stock sale The old Wall Street adage is to ""sell high."" Tesla did just that.

A week ago, Tesla announced it would sell $5 billion worth of stock at market prices ""from time to time."" Tuesday it announced it had completed that sale as of Friday.

The exact number of shares sold, and thus the average price of each sale, was not disclosed. Tesla shares have fallen sharply in the recent sell-off of tech stocks. Shares reached a split-adjusted record high close of $498.32 on August 31, but have lost 16% of their value since then through Friday's close. And shares were down another 11% in pre-market trading even before the Tuesday's filing.


The sell-off could be because Tesla was not added to the S&P 500 index, as many investors were expecting would happen, given its market value and recent record of sustained profitability. Being added to the S&amp;amp;P would have forced additional purchases by fund managers whose holders must mirror the blue chip index.

Shares of Tesla are still up about 400% since the start of the year, even with last week's sell-off.

The sale of stock is the second such offering Tesla has done this year to take advantage of the skyrocketing stock price. In February the company raised $2.3 billion through the sale of 3 billion shares. Adjusted for the recent split, that stock sale was at an average price of $151.60 a share.

CEO Elon Musk dismissed the idea of the need for sales of additional shares when asked about it by analysts in January.

“We're actually spending money as quickly as we can spend it sensibly,"" Musk said on a January 29 call, when the company posted its first annual profit. ""There is no artificial hold back on expenditures ... So in light of that, it doesn't make sense to raise money.""

But soon thereafter Tesla decided it didn't make sense to not take advantage of its climbing share price. And if it turns out that its shares hit a peak last week that it might not reach again for a little while, then Tesla apparently sold additional shares at close to that high point.

1321,1321,2020-09-09,"Opinions on NFLX? I was wondering how you guys feel about Netflix? I own pretty much any other FAANG stock but I'm not sure about adding NFLX to my portfolio. 

The reason behind it was mostly because I think that Disney, Amazon and Apple do have quite some potential to gain some more share of the streaming market.

On the other hand, there are some reasons for why I'm kinda interested in NFLX.
- their service is pretty cheap, especially when you share it with family members and friends, so they might be able to increase price without losing that much of their subscribers.

- their Stranger Things Drive-Into Experience shows that they're starting to make use of their most popular shows. I think they have more potential to market their popular shows and movies

- some other content; there is still room regarding more content, like sports, etc. And who knows when VR shows may become a thing.

- their current stock price is not too far from pre-covid levels, despite their strong user growth

1323,1323,2020-09-09,"Here is a Market Recap for today, Wed, Sept 9. Please enjoy! **PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, September 9, 2020**

Stocks shot up today and recovered some losses after sharp declines in big tech stocks. After several red days, shares of Amazon (AAPL), Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and other big companies rallied. On a sour note, reopening stocks (travel, cruise lines, airlines, hotels, etc) were down after AstraZeneca (AZN) announced it had its COVID-19 vaccine trial paused.

The S&P finished 2.08% up, the Nasdaq was 2.92%, leading the day, and the Dow finished 1.68% up. The volatility index (VIX) was down 4.8%, indicating increased risk appetite in traders.

Today, it was announced that AstraZeneca, a forerunner in the development of the COVID vaccine announced a pause of their experimental trial after one patient became more ill, pledging to make safety a priority and take the time necessary to let science prevail. This setback comes in stark contrast to politicians and governments who seem to imply a cure is just around the corner. Shares of AstraZeneca sank 2%, while those of companies competing to develop a Covid-19 vaccine including Moderna (MRNA) and Novavax (NVAX) rose.

US oil prices plunged nearly 7% today, after Saudi Aramco, the largest oil producer in the world, announced it would be slashing its selling price to Asia and the United States, per Bloomberg. ""Oil demand globally is really sluggish. All of the low hanging fruit from the global oil recovery has already happened,"" said Michael Tran, managing director of global energy strategy at RBC Capital Markets.

Asia-Us cargo rates are at the highest since March lows. For bulls evidence of a rebounding economy, for bears activity is fueled by liquidity and the shoe has yet to drop.

**Highlights**

* After falling nearly 20% in the week, Tesla (TSLA) stock roared back today, finishing the day 10.9% up.
* Big Commerce (BIGC) reported earnings today. While estimates were beaten, investors were not impressed. Stock is down 10% today (4% during session (6% after-hour)
   * EPS of -$0.38 v -$0.43 estimate
   * Revenue of 36.3 million v 35.6 million estimate
* Facebook (FB) underperformed the market, finishing a modest 0.94% up.
* Precious metals were up today, with gold miners ($GDX) leading, up 4.34%. Silver was up 1.58% and gold was 0.92% up.
* McConnell announced plans to unveil the new $300B relief bill and took procedural steps needed to set up a vote ""as soon as this week."" Schumer and Pelosi said ""Republicans bill which doesn't come close to addressing the problems and is headed nowhere""
* Analyst Upgrades:
   * $MSFT Microsoft had a nice boost by Morgan Stanley $MS who raised its price target from $230 to $245
   * $PTON Peloton had Price Target raised by Wedbush from $66 to $100

I went for AMD puts making 80k and cashing out my original 5k. Then as NFLX was falling under 500$ I went for NFLX puts on friday (460 strikes) based on the notion it ran up from 490 to 540$ for no reason on 8/26 (Maybe after news about releasing ""Cuties"").

Needless to say even when it rose causing my account to go down to $20k i still held and now have $6k which will probably be $1k by tomorrow based on Theta decay. It broke 500$ again yesterday, falling when all the other tech stocks had recoveries. AH it came above it, so I think if the market is falling, this would probably be the best FAANG stock to go for, cause it's the only one of the five not diversified enough into several revenue streams.

Also fell on 7/16 earnings cause of over-saturation of the market. With DIS+ and mulan, AZMN prime with the Boys, HBO Max with JS Snyder's Cut, and Hulu with South Park... why is NFLX still priced like it has room to grow?

Despite a coronavirus shutdown this year that temporarily halted most TV production, Netflix plans to release even more originals in 2021 than in 2020 — which would mark the latest achievement for a company’s whose massive investment in original content inspires both envy and ridicule.

Last year, Netflix spent $15 billion on content, which put its investment even with ViacomCBS (VIAC) but behind Comcast (CMCSA) at $15.4 billion and Disney (DIS), which shelled out $27.8 billion — according to data compiled by Variety. The streaming giant will up its spend this year to $17.3 billion, most of which will go toward original content, said BMO Capital Markets analyst Dan Salmon in January.

Netflix added nearly 26 million subscribers over the first six months of this year, bringing its total subscribers worldwide to about 193 million. By comparison, Disney Plus had 60.5 million subscribers worldwide as of Aug. 3 — though the platform has operated for a far shorter time, having launched last November.

Article:

Oracle Corp. ORCL -0.58% won the bidding for the U.S. operations of the video-sharing app TikTok, a person familiar with the matter said, beating out Microsoft Corp. MSFT -0.65% in a deal to salvage a social-media service that has been caught in the middle of a geopolitical standoff.

Oracle is set to be announced as TikTok’s “trusted tech partner” in the U.S., and the deal is likely not to be structured as an outright sale, the person said.

Microsoft earlier Sunday said in a statement that it was notified earlier in the day of the decision by TikTok parent ByteDance Ltd.

“We are confident our proposal would have been good for TikTok’s users, while protecting national security interests,” the statement said. “To do this, we would have made significant changes to ensure the service met the highest standards for security, privacy, online safety, and combatting disinformation, and we made these principles clear in our August statement. We look forward to seeing how the service evolves in these important areas.”

The move by Beijing-based ByteDance comes days after the Chinese government threw negotiations into doubt when it issued new export restrictions late last month on the kind of artificial intelligence technology TikTok uses. The algorithms, which determine the videos served to users and are seen as TikTok’s secret sauce, were considered part of the deal negotiations up until the Chinese policy change raising questions among the parties involved in negotiations over how to value the social-media business.

President Trump has said repeatedly that he would shut down TikTok in the U.S. if it isn’t sold to an American company by Sept. 15, though it isn’t clear if that is the operative deadline. In an Aug. 6 executive order, the White House gave ByteDance a 45-day deadline before it would ban the app, which the Trump administration says poses an economic and national-security threat to U.S. interests, if it isn’t sold to a U.S. buyer. That gives the parties until Sept. 20 to seal a deal.

TikTok has soared to around 100 million monthly users in the U.S., from about 11 million in early 2018, and they are considered among the most lucrative in the app’s global user base of about 689 million, though the app still loses money.

The Trump administration has pushed for a sale, expressing concern that TikTok could pass on data it collects from Americans streaming videos to China’s authoritarian government. TikTok has said it hasn’t been asked to share data with the Chinese government and wouldn’t do so if asked.",MSFT,tiktok rejected microsoft chose oracle instead source wsjcomarticlesmicrosoftdropsoutofbiddingfortiktoksusoperations11600039821httpswsjcomarticlesmicrosoftdropsoutofbiddingfortiktoksusoperations11600039821 article oracle corp orcl 058 bidding u operation videosharing app tiktok person familiar matter said beating microsoft corp msft 065 deal salvage socialmedia service caught middle geopolitical standoff oracle set announced tiktok ’ “ trusted tech partner ” u deal likely structured outright sale person said microsoft earlier sunday said statement notified earlier day decision tiktok parent bytedance ltd “ confident proposal would good tiktok ’ user protecting national security interest ” statement said “ would made significant change ensure service met highest standard security privacy online safety combatting disinformation made principle clear august statement look forward seeing service evolves important area ” move beijingbased bytedance come day chinese government threw negotiation doubt issued new export restriction late last month kind artificial intelligence technology tiktok us algorithm determine video served user seen tiktok ’ secret sauce considered part deal negotiation chinese policy change raising question among party involved negotiation value socialmedia business president trump said repeatedly would shut tiktok u ’ sold american company sept 15 though ’ clear operative deadline aug 6 executive order white house gave bytedance 45day deadline would ban app trump administration say pose economic nationalsecurity threat u interest ’ sold u buyer give party sept 20 seal deal tiktok soared around 100 million monthly user u 11 million early 2018 considered among lucrative app ’ global user base 689 million though app still loses money trump administration pushed sale expressing concern tiktok could pas data collect american streaming video china ’ authoritarian government tiktok said ’ asked share data chinese government ’ asked,Positive,0.9678

1337,1337,2020-09-14,"TSLA leaks (supposedly) At the upcoming Tesla Battery Day conference on September 22, Tesla will officially announce two million-kilometer batteries. If Tesla’s million-kilometer battery is really realized, electric vehicles will achieve a qualitative leap in mileage and battery life, and battery recycling will also become a thing of the past.

Single crystal cathode battery

Tesla single crystal cathode battery, this battery is also a lithium ion battery. It uses a new generation of single crystal NMC532 cathodes and a new brand-new electrolyte, which can enable electric vehicles to travel continuously for 1.6 million kilometers. The battery technology we are using can only maintain about 1,000 charge and discharge cycles, and this battery allows 90% of the battery's capacity to maintain a normal level after 4,000 charge and discharge cycles. Therefore, the single-cathode battery can still maintain 90% capacity after achieving 1.6 million kilometers of travel. This also means that if the battery is installed in a car, even if the whole car is scrapped, the battery can still be used.

Silicon nanowire

anode battery. The weight of the battery cell of this battery will be reduced by half, and the space occupied will be half of the current lithium ion battery. This means that with the same battery volume and quality, the energy density of the battery pack will be greatly improved. At present, the energy density of Tesla batteries is about 250Wh/kg. If this silicon nanowire anode technology is used, the energy density of Tesla batteries will reach about 400Wh/kg. At the same time, this battery has a high cycle life, and mass-produced cells are not far away. If this silicon nanowire anode battery is mass-produced and installed in a car, it may become a changer of current battery technology rules.

Tesla and the battery

As early as 2016, Tesla began funding the Tesla Canada Laboratory, which was composed of a team of scientists led by Jeff Dahn. Dann is a heavyweight in lithium-ion battery research. In more than 40 years, Dann has made many major breakthroughs in battery research. At the same time, in May 2019, Tesla spent US$218 million to acquire Maxwell, which specializes in the development of batteries and capacitors; in October 2019, Tesla acquired Hibar, the world’s number one supercapacitor manufacturer in Canada; in February 2020, SilLion acquired SilLion Inc., a lithium-ion battery company. Today, Tesla has held a number of battery core patents by hiring battery technicians and buying companies.

Summary

Tesla already has a number of new battery technologies. If the technology is mature enough, Tesla may no longer rely on Panasonic and Ningde’s battery supply in the future.

""We believe the significance of Battery Day is that it will showcase batteries as a pillar of Tesla’s growth strategy over the next two decades.""

""**Batteries as a pillar for growth – Master Plan Part 3**: We expect Battery Day to effectively be “Master Plan Part 3.” Tesla has talked to long-term battery capacity of 2 TWh – more than 30x its current capacity. This sharp increase supports growth in three areas: auto, stationary storage, and supply to others. Specifically in auto, battery growth underscores Tesla’s ambition of selling 20mn vehicles/yr, which would make it 2x the size of Toyota (the world’s largest automaker), and is 40x Tesla’s volume this year. While we see this as overly aggressive, we nevertheless foresee Tesla reaching 5mn units over time; market share gains of Japanese OEMs in the US in the 1980s/90s serves as a precedent.

""**Insourcing central to lower cost**: While Tesla will maintain partnerships with other cellmakers, the event is expected to highlight plans for Tesla to insource. Specifically, a robust battery manufacturing process is central to achieving scale and driving cost down.""

""**Battery cost reductions central to driving growth**: We expect Tesla to demonstrate it has multiple paths to reducing cost, both in the battery pack itself (potential target of \~$75/kWh), and outside the pack. Cost reduction is likely to be a key aspect of Tesla strategy, as it can help to unlock sales at lower pricepoints, and thus fuel further growth. Tesla’s approach in China serves as a case study for how lower cost can drive volume.

""**Battery technicals**: With significant aspirations on battery performance and energy density, it provides Tesla with another path to reducing cost.""

""**Supporting the stock price, raising TP**. Even if Tesla provides overly ambitious aspirations at Battery Day, we nevertheless expect the event to reinforce Tesla’s long-term growth narrative – central to the stock, while also reinforcing investor perception that Tesla is ahead of other automakers. We raise our '20 EPS to $3.33 from $2.55 and **TP to $400** from $280 – an energized growth narrative reinforces Tesla’s elevated stock price, and thus a wide cost-of-capital advantage.

***TLDR:*** **$**TSLA is likely partnering with $VALE to produce the insane quantity of Nickel needed to make Tesla’s vehicles, this is almost certainly happening for the following reasons…

***READ FULL BEST DD ON WSB***

* $VALE is the largest nickel producer in the entire world, with Tesla constantly calling for more Nickel production the partnership potential for these two companies is a match made in heaven.
* $VALE notified creditors on September 14th that it was paying off it’s $5 billion debt, suggesting a large deal leveling them an insane amount of capital.
* $VALE’s trading volume is up 37% from it’s average and has bullish whale activity in the options chain.
* Earlier this month, $VALE announced that they would be paying an extra dividend, on top of their regularly scheduled dividend, reinforcing the thesis of a strong balance sheet
* Tesla and $VALE already have a history of being bidirectional business partners for over a year.
* Conservative estimates reveal Tesla's growth plan leaves $VALE’s competitors ill equipped to deal with the demand for nickel Tesla needs to produce it's vehicles within five years.

**>>>TESLA NEEDS NICKEL<<<**

If there is one to take away from this post, it is the fact that Tesla vehicles need nickel and insane quantities of it. No one is better equipped to supply nickel to Tesla than $VALE. During Tesla’s Q2 earnings call, Elon [painstakingly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lvmOJGC_es&amp;t=37m39s) laid out how badly they were looking for a nickel producer.

“Well, I’d just like to re-emphasize, any mining companies out there, please mine more nickel. Okay. Wherever you are in the world, please mine more nickel and don’t wait for nickel to go back to some long — some high point that you experienced some five years ago, whatever. Go for efficiency, obviously environmentally-friendly nickel mining at high volume. Tesla will give you a giant contract for a long period of time, if you mine nickel efficiently and in an environmentally-sensitive way. So hopefully this message goes out to all mining companies. Please get nickel.”

**>>>THE STARS ALIGNED<<<**

The following points are largely circumstantial evidence, however when stacked together create an extremely powerful narrative and points toward the extreme likelihood of $VALE actually having lined up a *revolutionary* deal with Tesla.

**Quotes from Tesla Q2 2020 Earnings Call**

“There’s so much to be excited about. It’s really hard to kind of fit into this call, but the sheer amount of hardcore engineering, especially on the autonomy and the manufacturing/engineering front is mind-blowing. And then of course there’s Battery Day, which is coming up pretty soon. And I think that’s really going to surprise people by just how much there is to see.”-Elon Musk

“Yeah. The real limitation on Tesla growth is cell production at affordable price. That’s the real limit. So that’s where — we’re going to talk about — a lot more about this on Battery Day because this is a fundamental scaling constraint. And any part of that supply chain or processing at the cell level will be a limiting factor. So whatever it may be, anywhere from mining to refining — there’s many steps from refining to cathode and anode, cell formation. Whatever the choke point is, that will set the growth rate. And so we expect to expand our business with Panasonic, with CATL, with LG, possibly with others, and there’s a lot more to say on that front on Battery Day.”-Elon Musk

“Well, I’d just like to re-emphasize, any mining companies out there, please mine more nickel. Okay. Wherever you are in the world, please mine more nickel and don’t wait for nickel to go back to some long — some high point that you experienced some five years ago, whatever. Go for efficiency, obviously environmentally-friendly nickel mining at high volume. [Tesla will give you a giant contract for a long period of time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lvmOJGC_es&amp;t=37m39s), if you mine nickel efficiently and in an environmentally-sensitive way. So hopefully this message goes out to all mining companies. Please get nickel.”-Elon Musk

“Like the thing that bugs me the most about where we are right now is that our cars are not affordable enough. We need to fix that. So we’re all making progress in that regard, just sort of steadily gaining progress. So yeah, we need to not go bankrupt, obviously. That’s important, because then we’ll fail in our mission. But we’re not trying to be super profitable either, obviously, profitability is like 1% or something, just 1% or 2%. It’s not crazy. Last quarter, it was only like 0.1%. So we want to be profitable. Like I think just we want to be like slightly profitable and maximize growth, and make the cars as affordable as possible, and that’s what we’re trying to achieve.”-Elon Musk

**Philippe Houchois — Jefferies — Analyst**

“Yes, good afternoon. Thank you. You mentioned a few times about the constraint to growth is battery capacity still. And I was hoping you could clarify the scope of the Berlin plant you’re building right now. Will there be — the battery capacity consistent with the amount of assembly volume you expect to come out of Berlin? And if not, will you be able to source your battery requirements out of Europe? Will you have to import batteries from outside Europe to ensure production in Berlin?

Elon Musk — Chief Executive Officer

Okay. We can’t say too much about this, except that there will be local cell production, and that will serve the needs of the Berlin factory. Drew, is there anything…?”([TeslaRati](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-giga-berlin-battery-facility-missing-ingredient/) by Joey Klender)

VALE has joint-venture refineries in China, South Korea, Japan, the UK and Taiwan. These locations will help deliver nickel to the Tesla factories in North America, Berlin and China.

**Future Nickel Demand**

[According To Tesla CEO Elon Musk, This Metal is The New Gold](https://insideevs.com/news/440582/elon-musk-lithium-ion-battery-nickel-is-new-gold/)

The demand and future of nickel will continue to grow for the foreseeable future. Electric vehicles and other modern technology NEED nickel to function.

“With demand expected to increase from 2.2 million metric tons to somewhere in the range of 3.5 million to 4.0 million metric tons by 2030, the nickel market could become constrained.”-McKinsey and Company By Marcelo Azevedo, Nicolas Goffaux, and Ken Hoffman

**Elon Musk’s Emphasis on “Environmentally Friendly”**

During the call and clip that was hyperlinked above, Elon emphasizes the demand for an “environmentally friendly” mine. Historically, we all know mines have run into trouble with being friendly toward the environment. Today more than ever, a company's concern for the environment must be vocally expressed and physically acknowledged. If not, the reporters and media will bash Tesla for not being environmentally sensitive. Elon Musk understands this and is aware that the nickel company Tesla chooses must at least appear as if they are environmentally “sensitive"". Vale’s website has information on how they are [sustainable](http://www.vale.com/EN/investors/information-market/annual-reports/sustainability-reports/Sustainability%20Reports/Relatorio_sustentabilidade_vale_2019_alta_en.pdf) and [conscious](http://www.vale.com/esg/en/Pages/Home.aspx) of the controversies surrounding the mining industry.

“Given Tesla’s focus on sustainability, the company is likely to prefer to buy from miners of higher-grade nickel sulphide, which requires less power to process than laterite ore, said Lachlan Shaw of National Australia Bank.”-Reuters, Yilei Sun, Melanie Burton“There are three key suppliers - Brazil's Vale VALE3.SA, which operates in Canada using some hydropower, Russia's Norilsk Nickel GMKN.MM and BHP Group's operations BHP.AX in Western Australia. **""**[**Vale**](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/please-mine-more-nickel-musk-urges-as-tesla-boosts-production-2020-07-23) **is in the box seat,""** he said.”-Reuters, Yilei Sun, Melanie Burton

Just the appearance and attempt to be environmental is enough to scare away most journalists who are looking to make a hit piece on Tesla. To wrap it up, Vale has the efficient, sustainable, and environmental mining that Elon Musk is looking for.

**News Doesn't Care About Technical Analysis**

No matter how good the TA setup is for $VALE, news does not give a FUCK about TA. If it has a catalyst to moon... moon it will.

**Cash Flow**

The increasing and regular cash flow has built a very strong balance sheet for VALE and the consistent high yield will keep the loyal investors around. In addition to this year's regular dividend, $VALE is paying investors an extra dividend of 1.63% on the same day as the regular. According to research firms such as CFRA, the management team has been very active and engaged to keep the company moving in the right direction despite COVID-19 setbacks and a decrease in steel demand.

Currently, at a conservative rate, Giga’s mine would stop being able to satisfy Tesla’s Nickel needs by 2025, assuming they would be able to begin mining operations immediately. On the other hand, yesterday (Sept. 16), Vale announced that they had created buffers to reach production of 400 million metric tons of total mineral mining per year in a filing that was part of an investor tour presentation. Nickel is one of the five metals Vale mines.

**I'll scratch your back if you scratch mine**

Tesla and Vale already have a bidirectional relationship that GM and NKLA could never even dream of. Tesla and Vale have a history of working together. In March, “Antonin Beurrier, CEO of Vale-NC and Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, signed a contract, an offtake agreement for the delivery of intermediate mixed nickel and refined cobalt (Nickel Hydroxide Cake-NHC) produced in New Caledonia. The product will become part of Tesla’s battery composition. The purchased volume remains confidential.”-Tesmanian by [Eva Fox](https://www.tesmanian.com/blogs/tesmanian-blog/tesla-nickel-and-cobalt-contract-for-goro)  ([original french source](https://la1ere.francetvinfo.fr/nouvellecaledonie/tesla-contrat-nickel-goro-usine-du-sud-854234.html)). Tesla and Vale have already signed a confidential contract in regards to Tesla’s battery composition materials needed.

In 2019, Tesla hired an Engineer from Vale-NC to “facilitate procurement and familiarization with the products of the Caledonian plant”

""Tesla has recruited an engineer in a nickel-cobalt refinery in New Caledonia, that of Vale, in order to facilitate purchases for its large European electric vehicle factory in Berlin.""

**Vale using Tesla’s Lithium batteries at Guaiba iron ore port**

“Iron ore miner Vale is installing a Tesla battery energy storage system at Ilha Guaiba terminal in Rio de Janeiro state to help meet power needs at the port as it moves toward energy saving technology.”[\-London](https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/metals/082520-miner-vale-to-use-tesla-lithium-batteries-at-guaiba-iron-ore-port)“

The project will substitute 20% of the facility's power costs using Tesla manufactured lithium-ion batteries with technology contributing to decarbonization plans, Vale said in an Aug. 24 statement.”[\-London](https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/metals/082520-miner-vale-to-use-tesla-lithium-batteries-at-guaiba-iron-ore-port)

**Tesla’s technology is being used to lower costs at Vale’s iron ore** and to contribute to the “decarbonization plans”. If you remember in the Q2 conference call, Elon Musk was searching for *environmental and efficient* nickel. Vale has that now thanks to Tesla's battery technology.

***More Vale environmentalism***

‘Vale recently announced investments of over $2 billion to reduce direct and indirect carbon dioxide emissions by 33% until 2030, in accordance with the Paris Agreement. Vale said it intends to become carbon neutral by 2050.”

""As Vale continues to decarbonize its operations, the use of batteries will become an increasingly important part of the electrification of our fleet,"" Vale's energy director Ricardo Mendes said in the statement.

""This project allows us to test new technology in the field and accelerate Vale's energy transformation, which aims to achieve self-sufficiency by increasing electric power generation mainly through solar and wind sources in addition to our hydroelectric power generation,""-[London](https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/events/americas/caribbean-energy)

**Pricing and Math**

After calculating a very conservative estimate of how much nickel Tesla would be needing in the future, these were the results… (see figure below)

With a *conservative* estimate of a $43 billion dollar contract, $43 billion minus the operating margin (38%)= $16.5 billion. This gives the stock 28% upside. The price target for $VALE is **$15.36** with a 5% variance giving a low at $14.80 and a high of $16.00 Not to mention the stock market acts very irrational in times of hype, the stock could very well overreact to $20+CFRA’s current 12 month price target for VALE is $15.00, whom most likely have not anticipated Tesla news. (If they get the news, this thing will FLY based on what we have seen this year)

This is not taking into account that the price of nickel is lagging in comparison to its current and future demand. Current nickel price as of 9/16/20: $15,229.50 per ton

Once the demand for nickel goes up and the supply grows scarce, that's easy economics theory, nickel price goes up.

**The Plot Thickens**

Put on your tinfoil hats for this one…

Elon Musk has a history of hiding stuff in his tweets.

We remember this one. He had called out that Tesla stock was too high at a pre split price of $750

* The timestamp 8:11 signaled calendar date 8/11
* The date of posting May 1st turned into 5/1
* “Tesla stock price is too high imo” signaled that a stock split was imminent

What happened, on 8/11 Tesla announced a 5/1 stock split

Elon Musk has had a rough history with the SEC whom he outspokenly does not respect. This tweet was deciphered to read “Suck Elon’s Cock”

The Tesla short shorts represented the current Tesla models,

* Model S
* Model 3
* Model X
* Model Y

Elon expressing his lack of respect for the SEC and nobody is perfect

&#x200B;

Reporter: “But how do they know if it is going to move the market if they are not reading all of them?”

Elon Musk: “I guess we might make some mistakes, who knows?”

Reporter: “Are you serious?”

Elon Musk: “Nobody's perfect”

**Now let’s break down the battery day tweet**

* The tweet was tweeted on the same day as $VALE’s dividend announcement (9/11)
* Battery day is on the same day $VALE’s ex date for the regular and extra dividend (9/22)
* “Many exciting things will be ***unveiled*** on Battery Day”

1344,1344,2020-09-17,"$TSLA - Morgan Stanley previews Battery Day with ""7 Mind Blowing Things"" they're expecting Morgan Stanley:

""Ahead of Tesla's Battery Day on Sep 22nd, we publish some expectation 'benchmarks' for scale, efficiency, cost and technology that we believe may come to light. Based on our work with our Asia Tech team, we expect the event to be potentially narrative changing for Tesla and the battery market.""

""Elon Musk has promised 'mind blowing' battery tech to be unveiled during the highly anticipated September 22nd Battery Day. Our key expectation benchmarks to look out for:

1. **Capacity. We are prepared for Tesla to target Terawatt scale battery capacity plans.** Currently, we forecast Tesla to produce 439 GwH of batteries for their in-house production and 3rd party supply (combined) by 2030, accounting for just over a 26% share of the global EV battery market. Will Tesla target 1TwH by 2035? Or more/sooner?
2. **Battery manufacturing/production efficiency… 16-fold improvement?** With Maxwell, there would be theoretically a 16x production capacity increase by skipping the wet toxic chemicals to create the cathode, which then has to be dried and baked-off and needs a lot of floor space and ovens to meet that process.
3. **A doubling of energy density?** Battery density using the DBE system shows greater than 300 Wh/kg with a path to over 500 Wh/kg. By comparison, Tesla's most advanced (2170) battery today is around 247 Wh/kg. This implies potential to add 20% to its current highest density and could double it in the future. This could lead to vehicles with significantly more range – and could potentially push Tesla Model 3 to about 400 miles per charge with upside from there.
4. **Longevity… 1 million mile battery.** Battery life also shows improved durability with almost 2x improvement as Elon Musk recently stated ‘…the car battery pack is around 3-to-5,000 miles, but the newly designed pack that will go into production for next year is design\[ed\] explicitly for a million miles of operation with minimum maintenance...’. Extension of battery life has implications for cost of ownership, warranty, 2nd/3rd life battery use and buying time to allow the battery recycling infrastructure to catch up.
5. **Goodbye Cobalt?** Tesla has been spending a great deal of effort on researching new chemistries themselves to reduce and remove cobalt from the mix. Tesla’s battery research group led by Jeff Dahn in Halifax applied for a patent in November 2017 that describes a new battery cell chemistry that would result in faster charging and discharging, better longevity, and even lower cost. This has important ESG considerations as well.
6. **Battery $/KwH Targets:** The prevailing view is that battery cell cost can decline at a compound rate of 6 to 7% from just over a $100/KwH level today. Could Tesla communicate plans to potentially double this rate of deflation or to target $50/KwH or less by mid or latter this decade due to the additive/compounding effects of their process efficiencies, scale and energy density improvements? Additionally, we are looking out for an evolution in battery format that could be cylindrical with bigger diameter than the 2170\[0\]’s. Tesla is building a pilot production line to test mass production.
7. **An expectation that Tesla could emerge as a full-stack battery competitor...** Overall, the market appears to be leaning towards Tesla being a faster moving partner with scale that expands the market for all and investors are likely looking to reengage on existing battery makers post the battery day. Investors will likely also be looking closely at the state of collaboration with CATL. The million mile battery or cobalt-free battery is also a pipeline of CATL’s new technology. Tesla and CATL could potentially own the patents of those new technologies together and CATL would potentially be able to help industrialize new battery production.""",TSLA,tsla morgan stanley preview battery day 7 mind blowing thing theyre expecting morgan stanley ahead tesla battery day sep 22nd publish expectation benchmark scale efficiency cost technology believe may come light based work asia tech team expect event potentially narrative changing tesla battery market elon musk promised mind blowing battery tech unveiled highly anticipated september 22nd battery day key expectation benchmark look 1 capacity prepared tesla target terawatt scale battery capacity plan currently forecast tesla produce 439 gwh battery inhouse production 3rd party supply combined 2030 accounting 26 share global ev battery market tesla target 1twh 2035 moresooner 2 battery manufacturingproduction efficiency… 16fold improvement maxwell would theoretically 16x production capacity increase skipping wet toxic chemical create cathode dried bakedoff need lot floor space oven meet process 3 doubling energy density battery density using dbe system show greater 300 whkg path 500 whkg comparison tesla advanced 2170 battery today around 247 whkg implies potential add 20 current highest density could double future could lead vehicle significantly range – could potentially push tesla model 3 400 mile per charge upside 4 longevity… 1 million mile battery battery life also show improved durability almost 2x improvement elon musk recently stated ‘ …the car battery pack around 3to5000 mile newly designed pack go production next year designed explicitly million mile operation minimum maintenance ’ extension battery life implication cost ownership warranty 2nd3rd life battery use buying time allow battery recycling infrastructure catch 5 goodbye cobalt tesla spending great deal effort researching new chemistry reduce remove cobalt mix tesla ’ battery research group led jeff dahn halifax applied patent november 2017 describes new battery cell chemistry would result faster charging discharging better longevity even lower cost important esg consideration well 6 battery kwh target prevailing view battery cell cost decline compound rate 6 7 100kwh level today could tesla communicate plan potentially double rate deflation target 50kwh le mid latter decade due additivecompounding effect process efficiency scale energy density improvement additionally looking evolution battery format could cylindrical bigger diameter 21700 ’ tesla building pilot production line test mass production 7 expectation tesla could emerge fullstack battery competitor overall market appears leaning towards tesla faster moving partner scale expands market investor likely looking reengage existing battery maker post battery day investor likely also looking closely state collaboration catl million mile battery cobaltfree battery also pipeline catl ’ new technology tesla catl could potentially patent new technology together catl would potentially able help industrialize new battery production,Positive,0.9915

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

I threw 75% of my seed money in APPL right before the correction phase in early Sept, which I'm regretting that I should have taken more cautious steps.

The sailant picture of the market I perceive right now is that it is a down trend due to high volatility in near future with US election, Covid19 vaccine news, ongoing rebalancing of portfolio from the growth to the value and rising concerns between US-China relations (there might be more...). 

I'm decisive that I'm going to sell AAPL for now, I'm just anticipating a small spike in stock price. 

I would happily sell at 110-115 price range, and re-enter at 95-100 price range. I will surely take a cautious step when I re-enter, the US market whooped my ass in this correction phase.

I still believe AAPL is a great company with firm financial position to deliver value to the society. Along with upcoming 5G era and the release of the new iPhone, the future looks bright for AAPL. 

But, what's your honest thoughts on stock trend of AAPL and the big-tech growth stocks in general taking into account the upcoming election and other uncertainties?

Now, a few words on the criteria I'm using and sources of data.

&#x200B;

# 1. TheStreet score

The first filtering step is to get stocks with Buy recommendation at TheStreet stock screener ([https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html)](https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html). I'm only keeping stocks with A or A+ rating (top ones), although A-, B+, B and B- are Buys as well.

From thestreet.com:

***A (Excellent)*** *- The stock has an excellent track record for maximizing performance while minimizing risk, thus delivering the best possible combination of total return on investment and reduced volatility. It has made the most of the recent economic environment to maximize risk-adjusted returns compared to other stocks. While past performance is just an indication -- not a guarantee -- we believe this fund is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future as well.*

And about the methodology (source: [https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/detail/T.html](http://Valuation of entry parameters:)):

*TheStreet Ratings' stock model projects a stock's total return potential over a 12-month period including both price appreciation and* ***dividends****. Our Buy, Hold or Sell ratings designate how we expect these stocks to perform against a general benchmark of the equities market and interest rates. While our model is quantitative, it utilizes both* ***subjective*** *and* ***objective*** *elements. For instance, subjective elements include expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. Objective elements include volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows.*

# 2. Zacks Rank

It is required that the Zacks Rank is Hold, Buy or Strong Buy (so we're avoiding stocks with Sell and Strong Sell recommendations). The Zacks Rating utilizes a completely different system, based on company earnings-related data, in particular earnings estimate revisions and earnings surprises, to predict profitability of holding the company's shares. More from [https://www.zacks.com/education/stock-education/zacks-rank-guide-6](http://(average, from experts)):

*The Zacks Rank is a proprietary stock-rating model that uses trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises to classify stocks into five groups: Strong Sell, Sell, Hold, Buy, Strong Buy.*

*A portfolio of Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks has beaten the market in 26 of the last 31 years with an average annual return of* ***+24.3%*** *a year; more than double that of the S&P 500's +10.6% .*

# 3. Weiss Ratings recommendation

We're only keeping stocks with Buy (B) or Strong Buy (A) recommendation.

Wjat are these scores? This is what I found at their website ([https://weissratings.com/help/rating-definitions](https://weissratings.com/help/rating-definitions)):

*""A"" Rating:* ***Excellent.*** *The company’s stock has an excellent track record for providing strong performance with lower-than-average risk, and it is trading at a price that represents good value relative to the company’s earnings prospects. While past performance is no guarantee of future results, our opinion is that this stock is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future. Of course, even the best stocks can decline in a down market. But our “A” rating can generally be considered the equivalent of a ""****Strong Buy****"".*

*""B"" rating:* ***Good.*** *The company’s stock has a good track record for delivering a balance of performance and risk. While the risk-adjusted performance of any stock is subject to change, our opinion is that this stock is a good value, with good prospects for outperforming the market. Although even good investments can decline in a down market, our “B” rating is considered the equivalent of a ""****Buy****"".*

# 4.  Yahoo Finance  recommendation and target price

It is required that the [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold from experts. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current one.

# 5. MarketBeat recommendation and taget price

Similar to Yahoo Finance, it is required that the [MarketBeat](https://www.marketbeat.com/) stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current valuation.

# 6. Piotroski F-Score

The Piotroski score is a number between 0-9 that reflects nine criteria used to determine the strength of a company's financial situation, including profitability, leverage or operating efficiency. Zero is the worst value and nine is the best. As we can read in[ Piotroski’s paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9dc9/b030da18ab28d1e1a1bbf7e33fb5911f189e.pdf) from 2000:

*In addition, an investment strategy that buys expected winners and shorts expected losers generates a* ***23% annual return*** *between 1976 and 1996, and the strategy appears to be robust across time and to controls for alternative investment strategies.*

It is required that the score is 4 or higher. The values were retrieved from [https://www.gurufocus.com](https://www.gurufocus.com/).

# 7. Moody's Daily Credit Risk

Moody’s Daily Credit Risk Score is a 1-10 score, which provides a forward-looking, one-year measure of credit risk. It is updated daily and takes into account day-to-day market movements compared to a company’s liabilities.

The value is retrieved from[ https://markets.businessinsider.com and is expected to be in the range of 1-6. ](https://markets.businessinsider.com/)

# 8. InvestorsObserver Overall Score

The rank has a value in between 0 and 100. It takes into account both **technical** analysis and **fundamental** stock data. An Overall Rank of N means that a given company is rated above N% of stocks, therefore the higher the number, the better. My requirement is that the company has InvestorsObserver Overall score of at least 50.

More detailed explanation from [https://www.investorsobserver.com/learning-center/what-the-scores-mean/what-does-the-overall-score-mean](https://www.investorsobserver.com/learning-center/what-the-scores-mean/what-does-the-overall-score-mean):

*The Overall Score combines our two technical scores (Short Term and Long Term) with our Fundamental Score into one metric. This makes our overall score a great place to start when evaluating stocks, regardless of your investing style.*

*A low score doesn’t necessarily mean a stock is likely to go down, just that our system doesn’t think there’s much of a bullish case for it.*

Please note that the company profile data (short description) was taken from  [https://www.tradingview.com](https://www.tradingview.com/) (sometimes I shortened it) and dividend data was retrieved from MarketBeat.

Now, a few words on the criteria I'm using and sources of data.

&#x200B;

# 1. TheStreet score

The first filtering step is to get stocks with Buy recommendation at TheStreet stock screener ([https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html)](https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html). I'm only keeping stocks with A or A+ rating (top ones), although A-, B+, B and B- are Buys as well.

From thestreet.com:

***A (Excellent)*** *- The stock has an excellent track record for maximizing performance while minimizing risk, thus delivering the best possible combination of total return on investment and reduced volatility. It has made the most of the recent economic environment to maximize risk-adjusted returns compared to other stocks. While past performance is just an indication -- not a guarantee -- we believe this fund is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future as well.*

And about the methodology (source: [https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/detail/T.html](http://Valuation of entry parameters:)):

*TheStreet Ratings' stock model projects a stock's total return potential over a 12-month period including both price appreciation and* ***dividends****. Our Buy, Hold or Sell ratings designate how we expect these stocks to perform against a general benchmark of the equities market and interest rates. While our model is quantitative, it utilizes both* ***subjective*** *and* ***objective*** *elements. For instance, subjective elements include expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. Objective elements include volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows.*

# 2. Zacks Rank

It is required that the Zacks Rank is Hold, Buy or Strong Buy (so we're avoiding stocks with Sell and Strong Sell recommendations). The Zacks Rating utilizes a completely different system, based on company earnings-related data, in particular earnings estimate revisions and earnings surprises, to predict profitability of holding the company's shares. More from [https://www.zacks.com/education/stock-education/zacks-rank-guide-6](http://(average, from experts)):

*The Zacks Rank is a proprietary stock-rating model that uses trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises to classify stocks into five groups: Strong Sell, Sell, Hold, Buy, Strong Buy.*

*A portfolio of Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks has beaten the market in 26 of the last 31 years with an average annual return of* ***+24.3%*** *a year; more than double that of the S&P 500's +10.6% .*

# 3. Weiss Ratings recommendation

We're only keeping stocks with Buy (B) or Strong Buy (A) recommendation.

Wjat are these scores? This is what I found at their website ([https://weissratings.com/help/rating-definitions](https://weissratings.com/help/rating-definitions)):

*""A"" Rating:* ***Excellent.*** *The company’s stock has an excellent track record for providing strong performance with lower-than-average risk, and it is trading at a price that represents good value relative to the company’s earnings prospects. While past performance is no guarantee of future results, our opinion is that this stock is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future. Of course, even the best stocks can decline in a down market. But our “A” rating can generally be considered the equivalent of a ""****Strong Buy****"".*

*""B"" rating:* ***Good.*** *The company’s stock has a good track record for delivering a balance of performance and risk. While the risk-adjusted performance of any stock is subject to change, our opinion is that this stock is a good value, with good prospects for outperforming the market. Although even good investments can decline in a down market, our “B” rating is considered the equivalent of a ""****Buy****"".*

# 4.  Yahoo Finance  recommendation and target price

It is required that the [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold from experts. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current one.

# 5. MarketBeat recommendation and taget price

Similar to Yahoo Finance, it is required that the [MarketBeat](https://www.marketbeat.com/) stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current valuation.

# 6. Piotroski F-Score

The Piotroski score is a number between 0-9 that reflects nine criteria used to determine the strength of a company's financial situation, including profitability, leverage or operating efficiency. Zero is the worst value and nine is the best. As we can read in[ Piotroski’s paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9dc9/b030da18ab28d1e1a1bbf7e33fb5911f189e.pdf) from 2000:

*In addition, an investment strategy that buys expected winners and shorts expected losers generates a* ***23% annual return*** *between 1976 and 1996, and the strategy appears to be robust across time and to controls for alternative investment strategies.*

It is required that the score is 4 or higher. The values were retrieved from [https://www.gurufocus.com](https://www.gurufocus.com/).

# 7. Moody's Daily Credit Risk

Moody’s Daily Credit Risk Score is a 1-10 score, which provides a forward-looking, one-year measure of credit risk. It is updated daily and takes into account day-to-day market movements compared to a company’s liabilities.

The value is retrieved from[ https://markets.businessinsider.com and is expected to be in the range of 1-6. ](https://markets.businessinsider.com/)

# 8. InvestorsObserver Overall Score

The rank has a value in between 0 and 100. It takes into account both **technical** analysis and **fundamental** stock data. An Overall Rank of N means that a given company is rated above N% of stocks, therefore the higher the number, the better. My requirement is that the company has InvestorsObserver Overall score of at least 50.

More detailed explanation from [https://www.investorsobserver.com/learning-center/what-the-scores-mean/what-does-the-overall-score-mean](https://www.investorsobserver.com/learning-center/what-the-scores-mean/what-does-the-overall-score-mean):

*The Overall Score combines our two technical scores (Short Term and Long Term) with our Fundamental Score into one metric. This makes our overall score a great place to start when evaluating stocks, regardless of your investing style.*

*A low score doesn’t necessarily mean a stock is likely to go down, just that our system doesn’t think there’s much of a bullish case for it.*

Please note that the company profile data (short description) was taken from  [https://www.tradingview.com](https://www.tradingview.com/) (sometimes I shortened it) and dividend data was retrieved from MarketBeat.

1362,1362,2020-09-22,"$AAPL - Raymond James raise estimates ahead of iPhone 12 launch on ""favorable mix"" Raymond James:

We reiterate our Outperform rating on Apple and raise our price target to $120. Raising our estimates following our production checks ahead of next quarter’s iPhone 12 launch. While our total production estimates are in-line with current consensus, we expect upside driven by mix. Current production plans suggest the most favorable mix we’ve ever seen for an iPhone launch, and the introduction of a fourth iPhone model at a price between iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro will also help to boost blended ASPs. While the stock has already had a strong run since our upgrade last summer, **we don’t yet think all the benefits of what we expect to be a 2-year 5G upgrade cycle are yet reflected in consensus estimates.**

iPhone 12 mix and pricing. **We conducted channel checks across the iPhone supply chain last week, and confirmed that Apple will launch four new models** in the iPhone 12 lineup this year: an entry-level iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Max, Pro, and Max Pro. We provide a breakdown of specs for each model on the following page. While our sources don't have visibility into pricing at this point, we would expect the base model to start at $699 - the same as last year's iPhone 11, but with a smaller screen. We expect the Pro and Max Pro to remain premium tier phones, priced at $999 and $1099 to start. For the iPhone Max, we expect Apple to likely price it at a modest premium to the base model, in the range of $799.

**Our production checks are consistent with consensus expectations, but mix appears favorable.** According to our checks, build plans support production of \~75 million units for the launch, including 64 million new models. While we believe this is consistent with industry expectations, the mix assumptions driven by the initial build plans **suggest a meaningful rise in blended ASPs**. There's no guarantee that current build plans will reflect what consumers will actually buy, but the build plans provide insight into Apple's expectations. The table on the following page illustrates our production and sell-through estimates for the December quarter. We're assuming that Apple will build more aggressively on higher priced SKUs to make sure they are available for holiday purchases, and we expect that lower priced SKUs will likely sell out before Christmas.

Adjusting estimates. While our September quarter estimates remain unchanged (and well below consensus), we are **raising our FY21 EPS estimate to $3.93 to reflect our current assumptions for iPhone 12 mix**. Notably, if we assume December quarter sell-through matches production estimates, our revenue and EPS estimates would move higher by \~$5.3 billion and $0.09, respectively. For FY22, our split-adjusted estimate moves to $4.53, assuming Apple keeps the fourtier pricing scheme for the upcoming iPhone 13 and 14 cycles.

Our new $120 price target (from $110) is based on a \~26x multiple on our split-adjusted FY22 EPS estimate and 19x an annualized estimate of peak seasonal EPS of over $6/share. While this is above the 3- and 5-year average in the \~15x range, on an EV/FCF basis, our price target assumes an 18x multiple, well below the historical range in the low-20s.",AAPL,aapl raymond james raise estimate ahead iphone 12 launch favorable mix raymond james reiterate outperform rating apple raise price target 120 raising estimate following production check ahead next quarter ’ iphone 12 launch total production estimate inline current consensus expect upside driven mix current production plan suggest favorable mix ’ ever seen iphone launch introduction fourth iphone model price iphone 12 iphone 12 pro also help boost blended asp stock already strong run since upgrade last summer ’ yet think benefit expect 2year 5g upgrade cycle yet reflected consensus estimate iphone 12 mix pricing conducted channel check across iphone supply chain last week confirmed apple launch four new model iphone 12 lineup year entrylevel iphone 12 iphone 12 max pro max pro provide breakdown spec model following page source dont visibility pricing point would expect base model start 699 last year iphone 11 smaller screen expect pro max pro remain premium tier phone priced 999 1099 start iphone max expect apple likely price modest premium base model range 799 production check consistent consensus expectation mix appears favorable according check build plan support production 75 million unit launch including 64 million new model believe consistent industry expectation mix assumption driven initial build plan suggest meaningful rise blended asp there guarantee current build plan reflect consumer actually buy build plan provide insight apple expectation table following page illustrates production sellthrough estimate december quarter assuming apple build aggressively higher priced skus make sure available holiday purchase expect lower priced skus likely sell christmas adjusting estimate september quarter estimate remain unchanged well consensus raising fy21 eps estimate 393 reflect current assumption iphone 12 mix notably assume december quarter sellthrough match production estimate revenue eps estimate would move higher 53 billion 009 respectively fy22 splitadjusted estimate move 453 assuming apple keep fourtier pricing scheme upcoming iphone 13 14 cycle new 120 price target 110 based 26x multiple splitadjusted fy22 eps estimate 19x annualized estimate peak seasonal eps 6share 3 5year average 15x range evfcf basis price target assumes 18x multiple well historical range low20s,Positive,0.978

To say that Microsoft’s latest acquisition is a coup for the gaming powerhouse is an understatement. It not only adds 8 new studios to the company’s empire, bringing the total to 23, but, more importantly, ensures that ZeniMax’s titles will appear on Microsoft’s Xbox Game Pass subscription service the same day they hit the market. Titles from third-party developers often don’t make it to Game Pass until months after their initial release.

“With over 15 million subscribers currently on its Game Pass MSFT is doubling down on its consumer endeavors with this acquisition, a smart and strategic move in our opinion heading into its highly anticipated new console release,” Wedbush’s Dan Ives wrote in an analyst note following the announcement.

It’s important to note that Microsoft lost to Sony in the current console generation. It sold fewer units of its Xbox One than Sony sold of its PlayStation 4, roughly 50 million to 110 million, despite the prior generation’s Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 nearly matching each other in sales.

1364,1364,2020-09-22,"Video explaining the huge growth of large cap growth stocks (AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, TSLA, FB, GOOGL) I've seen this question everywhere on this sub: ""why did apple/tesla/[insert large growth company name here] growth so much so quick! They still haven't made a lot of profit! We are in a bubble!""

Well, it is difficult to explain why to every person individually and this new video from Ben Felix explains the reason why expertly.

https://youtu.be/foqswJT3Spc

The conclusion the video comes to is that you should just stick to low cost index funds (preferably globally diversified) rather than investing into large cap growth or trying to find the next Apple or Amazon.

**EDIT:** The definition of a ""growth"" company (as literally explained in the video) is a company that is ""expensive"" relative to the market. Expensive how? Well, relative to some fundamental ratio like P/B or P/E. Considering all the companies I have listed in my title have relatively high P/E and P/B ratios, you can say they are expensive. This makes them by definition a growth company. This isn't that hard to understand. If I said they are tech companies, no one would argue because they literally are tech companies. Well, just as much as they are tech companies, they are growth companies. They might not all be as expensive as each other, but relative to the market, they are expensive.

Now, it sounds absolutely crazy when I say this, but the first thoughts that popped into my head when I was watching this live - as a non-engineer - if what Elon and his co-presenter are saying, they have a *massive* moat around them. That is, the engineering capabilities they demonstrated on stage were explained somewhat not terribly, but still made sense to me. With that said, what did you guys think?

Also, some questions for the electrical engineers/others who have experience in this field - how viable and how possible does this innovation seem to you? Is this revolutionary as Elon is saying?

For everyone else, does this make anyone else feel like they are undervaluing TSLA? I mean, it definitely put some doubt in me as to my current valuation. This morning, if you had asked me, I would’ve definitely said yes. After watching this, I am not so sure. I might even increase the value of the company.  Now, I am an Elon fan but I also know his tendency to not follow through with deadlines, yet still succeeding massively due to his ability to build things from ground up (his first-principles .

1366,1366,2020-09-22,"Elon Musk says Tesla deliveries will rise 30% to 40% in 2020, touts new battery tech Tesla CEO Elon Musk said on Tuesday he expects vehicle deliveries to increase by 30 to 40 percent over last year, when the company reported deliveries of 367,500 vehicles. The new guidance from Musk implies deliveries of between 477,750 and 514,500 cars, a range that encompasses the company’s previously stated goal to deliver half a million cars in 2020.

Musk offered the updated numbers during the company’s 2020 shareholder’s meeting on Tuesday afternoon, which was accompanied by a presentation about Tesla’s battery advances. After thanking Tesla owners for their word-of-mouth marketing, he noted: 


“In 2019, we had 50% growth. And I think we’ll do really pretty well in 2020, probably somewhere between 30 to 40 percent growth, despite a lot of very difficult circumstances.”

The company’s shares dropped more than 6% during the presentation, which took place after normal trading hours.

During the “battery day” portion of the presentation, Tesla confirmed that it is making its own battery cells at a facility in Fremont.

Joining Musk on stage, Tesla’s senior vice president of powertrain and energy engineering, Drew Baglino, described the new cells as a “large tabless cell,” with a “shingled spiral” design. The cells are larger than the ones Tesla purchases from Panasonic and other suppliers, and offer “thermal benefits” which make them appropriate for use in electric vehicles. 

Baglino said battery, manufacturing and design changes underway at Tesla would eventually “unlock” a 54% improvement in the range of the company’s vehicles.

Musk, who is famous for being overly optimistic on such matters, said with all the battery and manufacturing advances Tesla is working on: “About 3 years from now, we’re confident we can make a very compelling $25,000 electric vehicle that’s also fully autonomous.” 

Near-term, Tesla says it aims to produce 10 gigawatt hours worth of its new battery cells at its pilot plant within a year. Musk noted that whatever cells it produces in Fremont would be supplemental to 100 gigawatt hours worth of cells it buys from suppliers. The company also said it had secured rights to a lithium clay deposit in Nevada to mine for its batteries.

On Monday, Musk warned that the advances announced at battery day won’t find their way into mass production until 2021, sending the company’s stock down about 6% ahead of the event on Tuesday.

Due partly to Covid-19 health orders that limit the size of in-person gatherings, Tesla postponed its annual meeting from July this year to Sept. 22, 2020. The company previously held its shareholder meetings at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California but moved the event to Fremont, where its U.S. vehicle assembly plant is based. Shareholders parked and sat in their cars at the meeting, which Musk characterized as a “drive-in.” They honked in lieu of applause.

Those who wanted to attend had to obtain a winning lottery-style ticket (or other special access) to the meeting. Otherwise, shareholders could log into a website to ask questions to be answered during the live-streamed event.

Since its last shareholder meeting in June 2019, Tesla’s long-time CTO JB Straubel resigned from the company. He worked there from the start, even before Musk took the CEO reins in 2008.

Tesla also appointed a new board member, Hiromichi Mizuno, formerly the Chief Investment Officer of the Japan Government Pension Investment Fund, and a famous critic of shortsellers. Long-time Elon Musk collaborator and proponent, venture capitalist Steve Jurvetson, is leaving the Tesla board as well, though he still sits on the board of Musk’s aerospace venture, SpaceX.

Remaining board members at Tesla authorized a five-for-one stock split, which the company implemented in August this year. The split followed four consecutive quarters of reported profitability for Tesla, and a season where Musk clashed with health authorities in California over Covid-19 restrictions that temporarily shut down their vehicle assembly plant in Fremont.

The stock split also followed a huge payout to Musk, part of his unprecedented compensation package. 

Expecting Tesla to talk about where its metals for batteries are sourced, and to promote battery tech suitable for Semi and Cybertruck vehicles, Cannacord Genuity analyst Jed Dorsheimer wrote in a note to investors before the meeting:

“The big question will be on follow through. It’s one thing to announce all these breakthroughs, which might be great for momentum algorithms, but like most things TSLA, the devil will be in the details, which sadly will take some time to play out.”

Cannacord maintains a “Hold” rating and a price target of $442 on shares of Tesla currently.

Shares of the electric car maker are up more than 400% year-to-date.

1369,1369,2020-09-23,"$TSLA - summary of analyst thoughts following Battery Day **BULLS:**

**Oppenheimer: ""Doing More With Less.** TSLA outlined a robust reimagining of battery design, manufacturing, and performance including targeting a $25K vehicle in three years and 20x capacity increase by 2030. It is ramping a pilot line featuring a comprehensive redesign of product architecture, basic materials, and process technology and expects to yield \~56% cost declines, 54% range improvement, and 69% capex reduction, with initial benefits seen over 12–18 months, achieviing run-rate at \~three years. TSLA reiterated 30–40% delivery growth in 2020 (implied 478–515K) ahead of consensus estimates. We are impressed with the ambition of the endeavor and believe this roadmap charts ongoing technology and cost leadership for TSLA enabling sales into the entire LDV market. While limited details may weigh on shares, we would be buyers on any near-tearm weakness.""

**ON THE FENCE:**

**Morgan Stanley: ""A Call to Arms.** Tesla’s battery day largely lived up to the hype, but didn’t clearly exceed it. We think the main narrative is that Tesla’s battery tech is outpacing current growth in supply… and it's time to spend significantly.""

**Credit Suisse: ""Battery Day plan shows elevated growth narrative ahead, but consider challenges in manufacturing ramp.** Tesla’s much anticipated Battery Day brought several key positives: 1. Battery plans to support aggressive growth over next decade; 2. Growth unlocked via cost reductions on multiple fronts, highlighted by ambitious vertical integration plans; 3. Yet another reminder Tesla is well ahead of other automakers in the push to EV. However, the biggest driver of Tesla’s success in its strategy will be its ability to successfully ramp manufacturing, and we expect challenges along the way. Amid lofty expectations into the event, we see a ‘sell the news’ reaction on the stock given Tesla is still 3 years away from its planned $25,000 vehicle and full benefits from its battery strategy. That said, we ultimately expect weakness to be bought as the event highlighted Tesla’s robust growth narrative.""

**Canaccord Genuity: ""Battery Day hits on manufacturing strategies, but may disappoint for those that see a tech juggernaut.** As expected, Tesla’s Battery Day and shareholder meeting provided a trove of clues as to the direction of the company. For Bulls, the operational and systems approach to reduce manufacturing costs for autos and energy might be enough to warrant momentum. Bears, however, are likely to point the shift towards what looks increasingly like a modern day auto OEM than a tech company.""

**Goldman: ""Capacity, Battery Tech and Cost in focus.** Tesla believes that it will see the initial impact of these changes within 12-18 months, and the full impact in about 3 years. In addition, Tesla stated that it could release a $25,000 car in about 3 years as a result of the reduction in pack cost. We believe that a vehicle at this price point (coupled with Tesla's other products) would help Tesla to address a wide range of the light vehicle market (and furthermore EVs offer savings for the typical US driver in the form of lower maintenance and fuel costs that we have previously estimated are about $800 per year vs. an ICE vehicle). We expect the ability and timing for Tesla to fully achieve these targets to be one investor debate post the event, as Tesla has not always met its past targets. While we are incrementally positive on long-term EV adoption, we believe that the company's premium multiple (Exhibit 4 and Exhibit 5) currently reflects this.""

**BEARS:**

\*\*Barclays: ""\*\*while it had the usual set of aggressive forward-looking targets, the key question of the stock is whether a more subdued Musk – who uncharacteristically cautioned that the battery innovations were ‘close to working’ – is enough to sustain the valuation. We can see a few days of ‘sell the news,’ especially as Musk did not forecast either the 1 million mile battery (which many Tesla fans expected) or using Tesla cars for vehicle to gird (which we expected), and the ‘one more thing’ was delayed Model S Plaid performance variant. Moreover, the Plaid variant was delayed. After that, however, attention will shift to delivery forecasts for 3Q20, where Musk was silent other than forecasting 30-40% unit growth for 2020.""

**Needham: ""Will Vertical Integration Make or Break Tesla? We Have 3 Years to Find Out.** At its well-hyped Battery Day yesterday, TSLA announced its transformational plans to more than halve the cost per $/KWH of its batteries through the strategy of vertical integration. The ultimate goal is to increase range by 54%, while cutting cost/KWh by 56% and investment per GWh by 69% in five steps: cell design, cell factory, anode materials, cathode materials and cell vehicle integration (outlined below). This plan will take three years to be fully implemented. While we applaud the company's ambitious plans, we believe it is an inherently risky move with steep execution and operational challenges.""",TSLA,tsla summary analyst thought following battery day bull oppenheimer le tsla outlined robust reimagining battery design manufacturing performance including targeting 25k vehicle three year 20x capacity increase 2030 ramping pilot line featuring comprehensive redesign product architecture basic material process technology expects yield 56 cost decline 54 range improvement 69 capex reduction initial benefit seen 12–18 month achieviing runrate three year tsla reiterated 30–40 delivery growth 2020 implied 478–515k ahead consensus estimate impressed ambition endeavor believe roadmap chart ongoing technology cost leadership tsla enabling sale entire ldv market limited detail may weigh share would buyer neartearm weakness fence morgan stanley call arm tesla ’ battery day largely lived hype ’ clearly exceed think main narrative tesla ’ battery tech outpacing current growth supply… time spend significantly credit suisse battery day plan show elevated growth narrative ahead consider challenge manufacturing ramp tesla ’ much anticipated battery day brought several key positive 1 battery plan support aggressive growth next decade 2 growth unlocked via cost reduction multiple front highlighted ambitious vertical integration plan 3 yet another reminder tesla well ahead automaker push ev however biggest driver tesla ’ success strategy ability successfully ramp manufacturing expect challenge along way amid lofty expectation event see ‘ sell news ’ reaction stock given tesla still 3 year away planned 25000 vehicle full benefit battery strategy said ultimately expect weakness bought event highlighted tesla ’ robust growth narrative canaccord genuity battery day hit manufacturing strategy may disappoint see tech juggernaut expected tesla ’ battery day shareholder meeting provided trove clue direction company bull operational system approach reduce manufacturing cost auto energy might enough warrant momentum bear however likely point shift towards look increasingly like modern day auto oem tech company goldman capacity battery tech cost focus tesla belief see initial impact change within 1218 month full impact 3 year addition tesla stated could release 25000 car 3 year result reduction pack cost believe vehicle price point coupled tesla product would help tesla address wide range light vehicle market furthermore ev offer saving typical u driver form lower maintenance fuel cost previously estimated 800 per year v ice vehicle expect ability timing tesla fully achieve target one investor debate post event tesla always met past target incrementally positive longterm ev adoption believe company premium multiple exhibit 4 exhibit 5 currently reflects bear barclays usual set aggressive forwardlooking target key question stock whether subdued musk – uncharacteristically cautioned battery innovation ‘ close working ’ – enough sustain valuation see day ‘ sell news ’ especially musk forecast either 1 million mile battery many tesla fan expected using tesla car vehicle gird expected ‘ one thing ’ delayed model plaid performance variant moreover plaid variant delayed however attention shift delivery forecast 3q20 musk silent forecasting 3040 unit growth 2020 needham vertical integration make break tesla 3 year find wellhyped battery day yesterday tsla announced transformational plan halve cost per kwh battery strategy vertical integration ultimate goal increase range 54 cutting costkwh 56 investment per gwh 69 five step cell design cell factory anode material cathode material cell vehicle integration outlined plan take three year fully implemented applaud company ambitious plan believe inherently risky move steep execution operational challenge,Positive,0.9977

In the end, this drop is not Elon's fault. Your losses are not Elon's fault. You have no one to blame but yourself, and honestly you should be happy this happened now and not after TSLA market cap gets pumped to $1T or you would be well and truly fucked.

1376,1376,2020-09-27,"I computed real life Volatility examples What is volatility? How is it computed?
-> Real life examples

Volatility is a key factor to take into account when building a portfolio in order to qualify if an asset is more or less risky.
Volatility appears in Modern Portfolio Theory and has gained a wide acceptance across the financial industry.

What is volatility?

Volatility refers to the amount of uncertainty related to the size of changes in price.
It is the degree of variation of a trading price series over time, in particular an asset is called volatile when there are big swings in price in either directions.

Volatility is relevant because:

The wider the swings in an investment's price, the harder emotionally it is to not worry
It can define position sizing in a portfolio
Price volatility presents opportunities to buy assets cheaply and sell when overpriced

MATHEMATICAL DEFINITION (see figure attached)

The volatility is just the standard deviation of the returns.
The standard deviation is a measure of the amount of variation of a quantity, the returns. It reflects the average amount a stock's price has differed from the mean over a period of time.

Volatility is without a unit and is expressed as a percentage. While variance captures the dispersion of returns around the mean of an asset in general, volatility is a measure of that variance bounded by a specific period of time.

We can report daily volatility, weekly, monthly, or annualized volatility

VOLATILITY IN REAL LIFE

I computed the annualized volatility of different U.S. stocks using data from Yahoo Finance (see figure attached)

The annualized volatility of these stocks is in the range of 20-40% with an outlier: Netflix (NFLX) at 52%. Also, UPS and IBM have the lowest volatility of the group.

If we plot the prices of NFLX and IBM as a function of time we see a lot more variations on NFLX than on IBM (see figure attached)

The overall performance of Netflix is very good, so volatility is not a bad thing. However holding this stock would have been quite emotional, especially in the past 2-3 years.

Volatility is not only useful to characterize stocks, it is also used for everything that has a price. Let's look at the annualized volatility of different assets (see figure attached)


To summarize:
- Volatility refers to the amount of uncertainty related to the size of changes in price
- Volatility is often associated with risk: the higher the volatility, the riskier the asset
- The higher the volatility the harder emotionally it is to not worry

1377,1377,2020-09-28,"$NFLX - Jefferies raises target on potential price hike, which could add $500m-$1bn to F'21 revenues Jefferies:

""We analyze the potential impact of a N-T price hike, which we believe **could add $500M - $1B to FY21 revenue (based on a $1- $2 increase in either UCAN or EMEA)**. We have confidence that NFLX can raise prices in int'l markets given its deepening content library and outsized consumer value proposition (see survey). After the last price hike UCAN growth accelerated 800bps (2Q19) and the subscriber impact was minimal. PT to $570, implies \~43x '21 EBITDA.""

**""After a change in language regarding pricing on the 2Q call, we believe a potential hike is probable in the near to mid-term.** In 1Q, Netflix said that they were ""not even thinking about price increases"", while the 2Q language was more open-ended. In this note we analyze the financial impact of a potential hike in each market, while also looking at the historical impact on both revenue and subscribers.""

**""Past price hikes have resulted in sustained revenue growth with limited churn.** We would highlight that after NFLX's last major US price increase (Jan '19) UCAN revenue growth accelerated \~800bps sequentially (+22% Y/Y in 2Q19 vs +14% in 1Q19). The boost sustained for the rest of the year, with NFLX posting +25% and +24% Y/Y UCAN growth in 3Q and 4Q19, respectively. Bears will argue that price hikes limit user growth potential, but we note that the initial impact (-132K UCAN sub losses in 2Q19, for example) is temporary and rebounds in subsequent quarters (+613K and +548K UCAN net adds in Q3 and Q4'19, respectively).

""**Our global June '20 Survey supports our view that NFLX can raise prices in int'l markets with limited churn.** 90% / 70% of India / UK NFLX subs said they would be willing to pay a higher monthly price. Encouragingly, 35% of Indian subs said they would pay >$2.34 more per month. While we continue to believe that sub growth will be the main focus over time (\~193MM paid subs vs our estimated \~850MM TAM) we see outsized pricing power when compared to other OTT services (YouTube TV just raised pricing from $50 to $65 per month, well above the monthly cost of NFLX).

""**We believe a near-term price increase could add $500MM - $1B in incremental 2021 revenue (2% - 4% upside vs. street).** In our scenario analysis we look at the potential impact of a $1-2 price increase across all 4 reported geos (see pages 5-6). While we believe NFLX has pricing power in each geo, we would expect price hikes to occur on a market-by-market basis rather than a global event. In our view, a $1-2 price hike in EMEA is most likely, and alone could add an incremental \~$700M to 2021 rev (assuming ARPU $1 above the street and subs 1M below street).

**We raise our PT to $570 (from $550), implying 43x 2021 EBITDA (vs our 37% 3 yr forward CAGR).** While the stock has hit a bit of a lull post earnings given soft 3Q guidance and a somewhat light summer content slate, we continue to believe NFLX will deliver normalized high double-digit top line growth with sizable margin expansion over time. Valuation remains the biggest hurdle, but we see significant long-term upside (bull case of \~46% stock appreciation by 2022) and sustainable high-quality fundamentals (competitive moat, top management team, industry shift to OTT).",NFLX,nflx jefferies raise target potential price hike could add 500m1bn f21 revenue jefferies analyze potential impact nt price hike believe could add 500m 1b fy21 revenue based 1 2 increase either ucan emea confidence nflx raise price intl market given deepening content library outsized consumer value proposition see survey last price hike ucan growth accelerated 800bps 2q19 subscriber impact minimal pt 570 implies 43x 21 ebitda change language regarding pricing 2q call believe potential hike probable near midterm 1q netflix said even thinking price increase 2q language openended note analyze financial impact potential hike market also looking historical impact revenue subscriber past price hike resulted sustained revenue growth limited churn would highlight nflxs last major u price increase jan 19 ucan revenue growth accelerated 800bps sequentially 22 yy 2q19 v 14 1q19 boost sustained rest year nflx posting 25 24 yy ucan growth 3q 4q19 respectively bear argue price hike limit user growth potential note initial impact 132k ucan sub loss 2q19 example temporary rebound subsequent quarter 613k 548k ucan net add q3 q419 respectively global june 20 survey support view nflx raise price intl market limited churn 90 70 india uk nflx sub said would willing pay higher monthly price encouragingly 35 indian sub said would pay 234 per month continue believe sub growth main focus time 193mm paid sub v estimated 850mm tam see outsized pricing power compared ott service youtube tv raised pricing 50 65 per month well monthly cost nflx believe nearterm price increase could add 500mm 1b incremental 2021 revenue 2 4 upside v street scenario analysis look potential impact 12 price increase across 4 reported geos see page 56 believe nflx pricing power geo would expect price hike occur marketbymarket basis rather global event view 12 price hike emea likely alone could add incremental 700m 2021 rev assuming arpu 1 street sub 1m street raise pt 570 550 implying 43x 2021 ebitda v 37 3 yr forward cagr stock hit bit lull post earnings given soft 3q guidance somewhat light summer content slate continue believe nflx deliver normalized high doubledigit top line growth sizable margin expansion time valuation remains biggest hurdle see significant longterm upside bull case 46 stock appreciation 2022 sustainable highquality fundamental competitive moat top management team industry shift ott,Positive,0.9873
1378,1378,2020-09-28,"Musk Sets Sights on Selling 20 Million Teslas by ’27. That Means 70% Annual Growth. Tesla ￼ CEO Elon Musk tweeted Monday morning that his company might sell 20 million cars by 2027 and he sees 30 million electric vehicles sold across the industry.

The numbers are almost too big to contemplate, no matter how investors dissect them, and dissect them they will.

Tesla (ticker: TSLA) is expected to deliver about 141,000 cars in the third quarter of 2020 and 483,000 cars for the full year. That amounts to about 30% growth compared with 2019—an impressive achievement given the global pandemic. Ford Motor ￼ (F) sales, for comparison, are expected to dip about 20% in 2020.

A few numbers were being tweeted. “Seven years for sure to 30 [million plus] new fully electric vehicles per year, six years maybe,” said Musk. “Five years is possible, but unlikely. An extra year makes a giant difference when it comes to exponentials.”

The 20 million stretch goal is more than 40 times higher than this year’s production and works out to an average annual growth rate of roughly 70%. There is precedent. Tesla increased deliveries by about 100% a year on average in the seven years from 2012 to 2019.

But Tesla was starting off a base of fewer than 3,000 cars. What’s more, it invested about $11 billion from 2012 to 2019 to produce more cars. It has become more efficient over time, but raising production to 20 million vehicles could take up to $100 billion. That is a rough estimate and, again, hard to contemplate.

Toyota Motor ￼ (TM) sold about 9 million cars in 2019. It spent roughly $100 billion over the past decade renewing its capacity and retooling plants as new cars were introduced. In the global auto business the numbers are huge.

None of this accounts for the ramp-up in the supply chain that will be required to take EV penetration globally from roughly 2% to 30%, based on Musk’s comments. He spoke to that issue at his company’s Sept. 22 battery technology day. “We’re not getting into the [battery] cell business because we—just for the hell of it,” Musk said. “It’s because it’s the fundamental constraint. It’s the thing that is the limiting factor for rapid growth.""

At the event, Tesla laid out plans to cut battery costs by more than 50%. It also outlined plans to cut the amount of investment required to build new battery capacity by about 75%.

Obviously, 20 million out of 30 million vehicles works out to market share of 67%. Tesla’s share of EV sales in the U.S. was about 55% in 2018 and 2019. Those are the first two years of significant sales of the Model 3, the company’s lower-priced model.

Musk also said he thinks battery improvements will enable the company to profitably sell a $25,000 car. The Model 3 starts at $35,000.

It is worth noting that Tesla achieved 55% share selling cars with an average price of about $75,000. Ford’s average selling price is closer to $30,000 per vehicle.

If Tesla were to reach 20 million sales, it would mean the company is generating, perhaps, $800 billion in sales and $100 billion in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.

There is a long way to go to get there. Investors may be inclined to believe Musk. He’s had a good year. Tesla shares are up 387% year to date, as of Friday’s closing price, far better than comparable returns of the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average.

Gains have made Tesla the world’s most valuable auto maker.

Tesla’s CEO Elon Musk told investors at the company’s “Battery Day” event last week that Tesla has secured access to 10,000 acres of lithium-rich clay deposits in Nevada, and plans to use a new, “very sustainable way” of extracting the metal.

Tesla’s decision to make its own battery cells, and to enter production of battery cathodes and associated raw materials, is intended to add in-house capacity alongside deals with external suppliers as demand for electric vehicles continues to rise.

1382,1382,2020-09-30,"Here is a Market Recap for today, Wed Sept 30. Enjoy! **PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, September 30, 2020**

Stocks traded higher throughout the day before pulling back steeply in the last hour of trading in another extremely volatile day. While major benchmarks are up around 4% in the last five trading days, intraday volatility has been extreme, making options trading difficult. Traders weighed a wild presidential debate and developments among Congressional lawmakers for further fiscal stimulus. Stocks recovered in the last 20 minutes of the market, capping off an extremely volatile final hour.

The Nasdaq (QQQ) finished the day 0.68% up, the S&P (SPY) finished the day 0.59% up, and the Dow (DIA) led the day finishing 0.99% up. 

Yesterday’s presidential debate between Pres. Trump and Joe Biden proved to be an extremely contentious affairs, with Trump frequently interrupting both Biden the moderator, Chris Wallace who could not control the candidates, and a slew of highly personal attacks from both sides. The Guardian branded the debate ‘a national humiliation’. With the election in 36 days, analysts expect volatility to increase as November 3rd gets closer. Tom Lee, managing partner at Fundstrat Global Advisors, said “I think markets are really nervous into those 36 days \[before the election\] and one of the things we have to think about is, when does nervousness price in the worst is yet to come? When do you think the worst is priced in? There’s $4.3 trillion in cash on the sidelines. I don’t think in the history of any financial market in the world do you ever have a top when there’s 20% of the equity market sitting in cash. Investor cash — that’s excluding the private equity cash, the record cash held by corporates too. So you’ve got tons of dry powder. People are bearish.”

The election comes against a dire economic situation, especially in the labor, with major corporations recently announcing new rounds of job cuts. Disney (DIS) announced it was slashing 28,000 jobs in their theme parks, cruise line, and retailers. Shell (RDS) announced it was cutting 9,000 jobs as the pandemic has affected the demand for oil. According to CNN business, tens of thousands of airline jobs could be lost as soon as tomorrow, as a federal prohibition on job cuts in the industry expires. Airline executives say they are prepared to keep workers only if Congress approves $25 billion in grants. 

Congressional lawmakers and the Trump administration are attempting to come to a deal in the near-term to provide additional fiscal relief to the families and small businesses that are struggling in the pandemic. House Democrats are pushing forward with a new $2.2 trillion proposal as speaker Pelosi and the White House make a final attempt to strike a deal before the election. Today, Pelosi and Mnuchin were unable to strike a deal after a 90-minute meeting. The pair said they will continue discussion as they continue to work to craft legislation that could pass both Houses of Congress. House Democrats are holding a vote on their plan today, a largely symbolic gesture as McConnel has already opposed the plan. Republicans are rumored to have a $1-1.5 trillion ceiling for any new relief legislation.

1385,1385,2020-10-04,"$NFLX - RBC provides an inside look at Netflix's corporate culture ""**We hosted a call on Friday, October 2nd with Erin Meyer, author of No Rules Rules – Netflix and the Culture of Reinvention, a recent book Erin co-authored with CEO Reed Hastings.** We delved into the philosophy behind Netflix’s Culture Deck, drawing on Erin’s inside look with interviews from over 200 current and past employees globally at Netflix, and sought to answer what made Netflix’s culture so radically unique, how sustainable it is as Netflix expands its reach globally, and whether the magic can continue without its current leadership. A replay is available upon request. Please contact your RBC sales representative for details. Key takeaways:""

""**What is the Netflix Culture?:** Netflix published its famous Culture Deck back in 2009. Among its key concepts were the Keeper Test (keep those you would fight to keep, adequate performance gets a generous severance package), and Freedom & Responsibility (“F&R”, which Reed sometimes referred to as “operating on the edge of chaos,” offering employees the ability to operate with maximum flexibility and very few rules. What makes such radical concepts work? Erin noted the foundational premise of the **Netflix culture is that Freedom Breeds Innovation, Process Kills Flexibility**. And to get to this level of freedom requires first achieving talent density by hiring the very best talent with pay at the top of the market. It also requires employees to give each other (including Reed) feedback frequently and candidly. Coupling that with the Keeper Test ensures those who don’t make the cut get a generous severance, while the “stunning colleagues” are retained with a continuously adjusted top of the market pay. Erin pointed out that while many corporate cultures tend to be filled with generalized positive terms, Netflix seeks to identify the key dilemmas (e.g. job security vs. talent density) and set guidelines on how employees should make decisions.""

""**Will Netflix Work Without Reed?** Erin believes the corporate culture makes the success of the company, and the exceptional quality of Reed is that he not only preaches the ethos, but actively lives it by incorporating culture discussions in every leadership meeting, frequently soliciting feedback and more importantly celebrating feedback received from employees up and down the company. Erin saw the same candor and transparency with new co-CEO Ted Sarandos and across the organization. But is Reed the tent pole that Netflix couldn’t run without? While Erin acknowledged F&R couldn’t be implemented without a leadership’s full support and commitment, she also saw the same principle fully embodied in Sarandos’s leadership as well as that of many other executives. Would the Netflix Culture disintegrate if Reed hops on a sailboat tomorrow? No, though Erin believes sustaining this secret sauce of Netflix’s success requires the next CEO to be fully committed to the same principles that made Netflix what it is today. As for the newly announced co-CEO structure, Erin believes it should be business-as-usual for Netflix save for a title change given the company’s unique F&R principles.""

""**How does the Culture Translate Overseas?** We believe in the next decade, Netflix’ game plan in international markets will be the key driver of its 500x30 (our estimate of 500MM subs by 2030). Erin was a skeptic when Reed asked if F&R and the culture of candor can be applied to Netflix’s global offices as the company prepared its big 130-country expansion in 2016. Some regions like the Netherlands work particularly well with this culture – which Reed believed was foundational to its Freedom principle, while other regions like Japan, Singapore, and Brazil initially struggled. To crack the culture code, Netflix introduced a focus on relationship building that provided the context for amicable candor, as well as more formal feedback sessions that seem to have done the trick for its Japan office, though Erin believes this will be an ongoing learning experience as Netflix continues to expand its global footprint.""

""**On the Edge of Chaos**: Erin believes the emphasis on candor and feedback is in fact not unique to Netflix, and is becoming a wave embraced by a growing number of corporates beyond Silicon Valley. The notion of talent density is also not unique. But where Erin thinks Netflix truly differentiates is in radically minimizing policies and processes – no vacation & expenses policy, no decision-making approvals, and no management by objectives like KPIs. Perhaps part of what drove Netflix’s impressive cadence of putting out hit content across genres (from The Crown to Tiger King) lies in the magic of what Reed calls “operating on the edge of chaos” or as Netflix’s Head of HR Jessica Neal puts it – “Don’t control your stunning employees, let them run free.”",NFLX,nflx rbc provides inside look netflixs corporate culture hosted call friday october 2nd erin meyer author rule rule – netflix culture reinvention recent book erin coauthored ceo reed hastings delved philosophy behind netflix ’ culture deck drawing erin ’ inside look interview 200 current past employee globally netflix sought answer made netflix ’ culture radically unique sustainable netflix expands reach globally whether magic continue without current leadership replay available upon request please contact rbc sale representative detail key takeaway netflix culture netflix published famous culture deck back 2009 among key concept keeper test keep would fight keep adequate performance get generous severance package freedom responsibility “ fr ” reed sometimes referred “ operating edge chaos ” offering employee ability operate maximum flexibility rule make radical concept work erin noted foundational premise netflix culture freedom breed innovation process kill flexibility get level freedom requires first achieving talent density hiring best talent pay top market also requires employee give including reed feedback frequently candidly coupling keeper test ensures ’ make cut get generous severance “ stunning colleague ” retained continuously adjusted top market pay erin pointed many corporate culture tend filled generalized positive term netflix seek identify key dilemma eg job security v talent density set guideline employee make decision netflix work without reed erin belief corporate culture make success company exceptional quality reed preaches ethos actively life incorporating culture discussion every leadership meeting frequently soliciting feedback importantly celebrating feedback received employee company erin saw candor transparency new coceo ted sarandos across organization reed tent pole netflix ’ run without erin acknowledged fr ’ implemented without leadership ’ full support commitment also saw principle fully embodied sarandos ’ leadership well many executive would netflix culture disintegrate reed hop sailboat tomorrow though erin belief sustaining secret sauce netflix ’ success requires next ceo fully committed principle made netflix today newly announced coceo structure erin belief businessasusual netflix save title change given company ’ unique fr principle culture translate overseas believe next decade netflix ’ game plan international market key driver 500x30 estimate 500mm sub 2030 erin skeptic reed asked fr culture candor applied netflix ’ global office company prepared big 130country expansion 2016 region like netherlands work particularly well culture – reed believed foundational freedom principle region like japan singapore brazil initially struggled crack culture code netflix introduced focus relationship building provided context amicable candor well formal feedback session seem done trick japan office though erin belief ongoing learning experience netflix continues expand global footprint edge chaos erin belief emphasis candor feedback fact unique netflix becoming wave embraced growing number corporates beyond silicon valley notion talent density also unique erin think netflix truly differentiates radically minimizing policy process – vacation expense policy decisionmaking approval management objective like kpis perhaps part drove netflix ’ impressive cadence putting hit content across genre crown tiger king lie magic reed call “ operating edge chaos ” netflix ’ head hr jessica neal put – “ ’ control stunning employee let run free ”,Positive,0.9972

""3Q20 app downloads are not as clear a signal as in 1H, but, as we previously published, suggest **net adds are tracking modestly above what has been broadly considered a conservative guide of 2.5m** global net adds (vs. 6.8m in 3Q19). We raised 3Q20/4Q20 by 1.0m/2.1m to 3.5m/6.6m (street 3Q 2.88m), bringing 2020 to an even 36.0m. Still, we are trimming 2021e global net adds by 1.8m to 26.5m (Street 28m) given the maturity shown in the U.S. and Latam pre-COVID, EMEA showing signs of peaking pre-COVID, likely 4Q20/1Q21 price increases (positive for revenue growth, but negative for churn), and major content hits being back-half weighted in 2021 (e.g. Witcher S2 in 2H21), and after considering quarterly flow for 2021. ’20 EPS raised $0.11 to $6.18 and ’21 EPS raised $0.26 to $8.58.""

""Competition & Content: In 3Q20, according to Nielsen **Netflix had 3x the viewing of Hulu, 4x that of Amazon and >6x Disney+’s**. Per Sensor Tower, Netflix also led 3Q app downloads in the U.S. with 8.4m and globally with 51.7m (Disney+ was 2nd in the U.S. at 7.8m, Amazon was 2nd globally with 34.4m). Cross referencing Netflix & Nielsen top weekly titles, Netflix clearly continued to launch breakout new original content in 3Q20 incl films The Old Guard and Kissing Booth 2 and TV series Umbrella Academy S2, Unsolved Mysteries, Away, and Ratched, among others. Notably, four non-English series made Netflix’s version of the weekly top 10 lists in the U.S. this quarter: Dark Desire (Mexican thriller); IP Man 4 (Hong Kong martial arts film); Cuties (controversial French film); and #Alive (Korean YA zombie film). An interesting case study will be how many viewers of The Last Dance Netflix was able to add in the U.S. to the 21+m homes that tuned into the series on ESPN earlier this year.""

""Outlook: **Netflix continues to capture a growing share of global video consumption, and we do not see Netflix ever yielding its leadership position to “the old guard”**, our traditional media companies. Still, we see risk/reward as balanced and **do not see a catalyst near-term for Netflix’s stock to discount substantially more growth than it already is**. Historically that has come from Netflix beating subscriber estimates, but as outlined above 2021 consensus does not appear conservative to us. Note: while there will be a number of competing int’l streaming launches in ‘21, we expect little-to-no impact on Netflix. Also, we have included a 10% boost to production costs due to COVID-19 in our forecast, but still see only an $800m FCF loss in 2021.""

""Valuation: Netflix trades at 8x 2021 revenue, but a reasonable 19x 2025 P/E. Our DCF target remains $525 (WACC still 10%, and growth 3%).

""Yesterday, the House subcommittee on Antitrust released a 450-page report outlining anticompetitive threats posed by AAPL, AMZN, FB and GOOGL. Our key take-aways from the 45 AAPL pages include: a) dozens of complaints about AAPL (out of the 20mm app developers and 1.8mm apps in AAPL's App Store), with zero positives about AAPL's value to consumers or lifeimproving innovations; b) underscores AAPL's strong shareholder value proposition and finds fault with widely used business practices such as bundling; and c) most complaints about AAPL are biz judgments (they charge too much, they pre-load their apps, etc), and not easily fixable through regulation. Finally, because AAPL's core asset is access to nearly 1B of the wealthiest consumers, we do not expect this report to materially impact valuation.""

""Relating to key issues raised by the House report about AAPL, regulatory experts at Technology Policy Institute (TPI) believe:

1. ""The key regulatory question is whether Apple uses the App Store to systematically foreclose competition or engage in unfair or deceptive practices using quality control as an excuse. This question cannot be answered by claims of a few developers, whose particular apps may have been technically deficient, failed to meet some security standard, or whose apps were unfortunately harmed by legitimate changes in the App Store. ""
2. ""Determining whether Apple behaved anti-competitively when it pre-loads its owned 40 apps will involve considerations such as the difficulty of downloading and installing replacements for AAPL's pre-loaded apps (ie, none), the level of integration of AAPL's owned apps with its operating system, and any negative effects on innovation inside AAPL's app ecosystem.""
3. ""Whether Apple’s app review policies are antitrust violations will hinge on how its policies affect the market and whether prosecutors can prove that the issues raised are not just disputes between large companies over how to distribute profits and protect user privacy/security. Not being able to pay for Netflix and Spotify within an app are not, by definition, harms. To prove harm, a plaintiff would have to demonstrate that their absence foreclosed access, thereby harming consumers.""

**DO NOT PASS GO:** At the conclusion of a 16-month investigation, the House Judiciary subcommittee found that monopoly power existed at Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL), according to CNBC's Lauren Feiner. While the findings from the report cited monopoly power on all the previously mentioned companies, the report noted Facebook enjoyed monopoly power in online advertising and social networking. The almost 450-page report also suggested Congress make changes to antitrust laws that could result in parts of the companies' businesses being separated. on antitrust reported its findings. However, a government effort to break up Facebook from Instagram and WhatsApp would defy established law, cost billions of dollars and harm consumers, The Wall Street Journal's Jeff Horwitz wrote, citing a paper that company lawyers have prepared in the wake of rising antitrust legal threats.

The company heads will address liability protections that internet companies enjoy, data privacy and media consolidation. It will be the second time this year that top tech executives testify before Congress.

**BIRDWATCH:** Twitter is developing more tools to minimize misinformation across its platform including a new product coined ""Birdwatch,"" Sarah Perez of Tech Crunch reported. Birdwatch reportedly cuts down on misinformation by providing more context for tweets, in the form of notes. Birdwatch gives viewers the added functionality to ""attach notes to a tweet and the notes can be viewed when clicking on the binoculars button on the tweet itself,"" thereby giving additional context about the statement, wrote Perez.   


**TIKTOK LATEST:** U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols said he will hold a November 4 hearing on whether to allow the U.S. government to block transactions with TikTok that the company cautioned would effectively ban the app's use in the U.S., Reuters reported. China has taken the stance that the United States' bans on mobile applications like TikTok, owned by BytedDance, are in violation of the World Trade Organization's rules. The Fly notes that Oracle (ORCL) and Walmart (WMT) have agreed to take stakes in TikTok Global, a newly created U.S. company that will own most of the app's operations worldwide.

1399,1399,2020-10-12,"Apple Launches New iPhones Tuesday. Wall Street Is Pumped Tuesday is the day. After many months of investor buildup, Apple is finally about to unveil the first generation of 5G iPhones, which likely will be called iPhone 12.

The details have been widely leaked. Apple ￼ (ticker: AAPL) is expected to unveil four models. Here’s how Raymond James analyst Chris Caso laid it out in a research note last month:

• iPhone 12, with a 5.4-inch screen, priced at $699

• iPhone 12 Max, with a 6.1-inch screen, priced at $799

• iPhone 12 Pro, also with a 6.1-inch screen, plus higher end cameras, priced at $999

• iPhone 12 Pro Max, with a 6.6-inch screen, priced at $1,099

There is also some speculation about new Apple-branded over-the-ear headphones called AirPods Studio, and perhaps a new product for tracking things with Bluetooth called AirTags. But there’s no question that this event is all about the iPhone, and the expectations are sky high.

Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives writes this morning that this will be the most important Apple iPhone product cycle since the iPhone 6 in 2014. That time, Apple finally moved beyond 4-inch displays—the iPhone 6 was 4.7 inches and the beloved iPhone 6s a whopping 5.5 inches.

All of the new phones will run on 5G networks. (No coincidence that the tag line for the event is “Hi, Speed.”) Ives notes that the Pro versions are expected to have Lidar sensor technology, useful for augmented reality applications, as well as enhanced rear-camera technology. Ives expects preorders to kick off in a few weeks, with two of the models shipping later this month and the other two in mid-to-late November.

Ives says the U.S. version of the phones will be capable of accessing speedy millimeter wave version of 5G, which he thinks “could be a game changer looking ahead as more infrastructure, technology and apps are built around this transformational 5G highway over the coming years.”

Ives is particular bullish on the prospect for the new phones in China—he thinks the country will account for 20% of upgrades over the coming year.

“With 5G now in the cards and roughly 40% of [the]...iPhone installed base not upgrading their phones in the last 3.5 years, [Apple CEO Tim] Cook & Co. have the stage set for a supercycle 5G product release, which should drive shares further,” he writes. “Although the soft macro and Covid backdrop will clearly dent some demand, we believe the underlying growth drivers for iPhone 12 success are unparalleled for Cupertino.”

Ives maintains his Outperform rating and $150 price target.

Meanwhile, RBC Capital analyst Robert Muller on Monday repeated his Outperform rating, while lifting his price target on Apple stock to $132 from $111. Muller writes that he thinks the new iPhone lineup will “kick off a significant replacement cycle which we believe will be a multiyear process as new applications and spectrum become available over time.”

Muller is also bullish about Apple’s push into the fitness category with the pending launch of the Fitness+ service. “We view Apple’s upcoming Fitness+ offering as a worthwhile competitor within the Health and Wellness category, and expect the service will benefit from pandemic-related at-home spending trends,” he writes. “In addition to meaningful revenue/EPS contribution, we expect notable synergy opportunities across Watch/TV/iPad/Services and view the offering as one more way that Apple can drive customer loyalty and, importantly, repeat purchases.”

Assuming a 20% adoption rate by Apple Watch customers, Muller estimates that Fitness+ could generate $3 billion in annual revenue by 2022. “Our revenue estimates are stand-alone for Fitness+; however, Apple Watch is a requirement and unit sales could benefit from interest in Fitness+,” he writes.  “In total, we view Fitness+ as an ideal candidate to drive additional Apple-related spend and, importantly, keep customers more engaged and immersed within the Apple ecosystem, which should drive future iPhone sales.”

1408,1408,2020-10-15,"'Nightmare' U.S. stock valuations driven by 'young, dumb' investors, fund manager says U.S. equity valuations have become a ""total nightmare"" fueled by ""young and dumb"" investors, according to Cole Smead, president and portfolio manager at Smead Capital Management.

At present, investors are paying 22 times forward earnings to purchase stocks on the S&P 500, 50% higher than the 10-year average valuations across the index.

The forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio divides the current share price of a company by its estimated future earnings per share (EPS).

Much of the market rally which took the U.S. benchmark from correction territory in March to an all-time high in August was driven by tech megastocks and a bullish options market.

""The buying that went on in August and September is a 10-year phenomenon the likes of which we have never seen, among millennials and in the risk-taking among people that don't want to own bonds and want to own overpriced U.S. quality businesses, it is of record proportions,"" Smead told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Thursday.

He added that current valuations were an example of ""stock market failure"" driven by millennials speculating in the stock market for the first time. Smead projected that markets could be in for a nosedive since despite its monetary policy shoring up credit markets, the Federal Reserve ""can't save a stock market.""

""They are buying bullish call options that expire inside two weeks. There was ($500 billion) of bullish call options bought in a four-week stretch by small retail traders,"" Smead said.

A call option is a contract between the buyer and seller of the call to exchange a security, in this case a stock, at an agreed price.

""In '99 it was $100 billion, in '07, it was $100 billion. That is what young, dumb investors are doing and when the market makers see those (call buying) out there, they sell that call to that person and they buy the stock,"" Smead added.

He suggested that the willingness of wealthy investors and the baby boomer generation to ""ride the index to a fault"" and overpay for stalwart American businesses such as Costco and Microsoft was also detrimental.

""Microsoft is a wonderful company, but at 40 times earnings, there is a 0% chance of that producing wealth for someone over the next 10 years that will meet their needs.""

Despite a sharp tech sell-off in early September, Microsoft shares remain 40% higher since the turn of the year, while fellow tech titans Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Facebook and Netflix have all been on a tear since March's crash.

1414,1414,2020-10-18,"$TSLA Tesla Earnings Q3 2020 Discussion **TSLA Price Historically Falls After Earnings**

Be careful with your plays. We can pull the historical data and see exactly how often this happens.

Musk has said TSLA aims to deliver 500k vehicles by the year end. I paid for [troyteslike](https://twitter.com/TroyTeslike)'s prerelease data and am sharing it with you. troyteslike thinks **500k is 55% likely.**

&#x200B;

**Possible Catalysts**

The big caveat I see is the FSD beta coming out on tuesday to early access and the possible non-GAAP EPS beat.

Musk claims he has minimal interventions  in the beta which I think is a huge deal - it must mean FSD with city turns is being released. However I'm not sure how well the markets will be able to digest the magnitude of this before earnings.

After plugging in the right fundamental values, the model is suggesting that with 5 years of projected growth being considered, which I think is reasonable for a company like Microsoft, that the intrinsic value of the company is $500 a share, meaning its being undervalued by nearly 57%. 

I am wondering how accurate others think this might be. If it’s an accurate assessment, then it seems like an absolutely amazing value investment into what’s already one of the historically strongest stocks ever. Even looking at this estimate more conservatively, we’re still talking about a 57% margin of safety which is a lot of wiggle room to work with. 

I used the same approach with AAPL and it suggests AAPL is a bit over priced, putting its intrinsic value at roughly $96. Not as extreme but still interesting to see such big differences in estimated value between two of the biggest blue chip stocks out there. 

Do fundamentals like this mean anything to these highly rated stocks? Should I focus more on company news and/or technicals? Should I take intrinsic value estimations with a handful of salt?

Tesla’s third-quarter was impressive, with the electric car maker producing a total of 145,036 vehicles comprised of 16,992 Model S and Model X and 128,044 Model 3 and Model Y. The company also delivered 139,300 vehicles comprised of 124,100 Model 3 and Model Y, as well as 15,200 Model S and Model X.

Tesla’s strong Q3 results were likely due to the Model Y ramp in the United States and the increasing Model 3 production at Gigafactory Shanghai. With these, expectations were high that Tesla would once more post a profit this third quarter.

The linked article shows ample evidence that Apple is moving towards launching a search engine offering. Has this been factored into Apple and Google’s stock price? Given Apple recently hit $125 a share and is now at $115 ($116 after hours), it could represent a very good entry point to take advantage of this being introduced in 2021.

1440,1440,2020-10-28,"Consumer Reports: Tesla Autopilot 'a distant second' to GM's Super Cruise in hands-free test Tesla Autopilot 'a distant second' to GM's Super Cruise in hands-free test: Consumer Reports

DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co's (GM.N) Super Cruise once again edged Tesla's (TSLA.O) Autopilot in an evaluation of 17 vehicles equipped with active driving assistance systems (ADAS) by Consumer Reports, the testing organization said on Wednesday.

A Tesla Model Y fitted with Autopilot finished ""a distant second,"" the group said, to a Cadillac CT6 equipped with Super Cruise, which GM is rolling out to more than 20 vehicles - including its new Hummer electric pickup truck - over the next three years.

Safety and insurance researchers have frequently warned of the risks of consumers overestimating ADAS systems' abilities, a misconception increased by some automakers calling their products Autopilot, ProPilot or Co-Pilot.

In 2018, the Cadillac CT6 with Super Cruise scored higher than a Tesla Model 3 with Autopilot, in a Consumer Reports test of just four vehicles equipped with ADAS.

In the latest test, conducted this summer on a track and on public roads, the Cadillac scored 69 points out of a possible 100, while the Tesla scored 57. A Lincoln Corsair equipped with Ford Motor Co's (F.N) Co-Pilot 360 system, finished third with 52.

The critical difference in the Super Cruise system is a driver-facing infrared camera to make sure he or she is paying attention to the road and is ready to take over manual control when necessary, said Kelly Funkhouser, head of connected and automated vehicle testing at Consumer Reports.

The group noted that Autopilot can shut off abruptly in some situations, while Super Cruise did a better job of notifying the driver when the system is disengaging.

In recent European safety testing, a Tesla Model 3 with Autopilot placed sixth out of 10 systems, getting high marks for performance and ability to respond to emergencies, but falling short on its ability to maintain a driver’s focus on the road.

Losses in the stock market accelerated today as market participants nervously eyed rising coronavirus case counts in the US and Europe, the presidential election a mere 6 days away, and developments out of Washington regarding stimulus.

The Nasdaq (QQQ) slid 3.90$ down, the S&P 500 (SPY) fell 3.41%, and the Dow Jones (DIA) fell 3.35%.

In the United States, there were 73,240 coronavirus cases reported yesterday, according to Johns Hopkins University. Alarmingly, the average number of daily new cases in the US rose  21% compared to the previous week. According to an article from CNN Health, the surge is hitting all parts of the country, with 40 states reporting at least a 10% increase in daily average cases, compared to last week. Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of Brown University School of Public Health, said, “Cases are rising quickly. If we go back about six, seven weeks ago to Labor Day, we \[the United States\] were at about 35,000 cases a day.”  U.S. hospitalizations related to COVID-19 have risen by at least 10% over the past week across 32 U.S. states and Washington, D.C., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. One good thing is the FDA approval of remdesivir, a therapeutic developed by Gildead (GILD) that was used to treat the president.

In Europe, the average number of daily cases rose by 33% compared to last week, accounting for the greatest proportion of new cases in the world, according to data compiled from worldometer.info. France is the hardest hit country in Europe. On Tuesday, it reported more than 33,400 new cases and 523 coronavirus deaths in 24 hours, as well as a net increase of 74 admissions to intensive care, bringing the total  to 2,918, over half the country's overall capacity of 5,800. French President Emmanuel Macron announced nationwide restrictions for the next four weeks. Germany joined France, imposing its own four-week nationwide lockwide, which includes curfew and restrictions on businesses like gyms, bars, restaurants, hairdressers etc.

Yesterday, President Trump publicly acknowledged that an agreement on additional stimulus would not happen until after the election. While he signaled that his administration was still willing to negotiate, with the election a mere 6 days away, the chances of stimulus passing before then are practically zero.

_____
The lack of fiscal first-quarter 2021 guidance from Apple means that investors and analysts don’t get a hint at how Apple is projecting the sales performance of the iPhone 12, which went on sale in October. 


Apple stock dropped over 4% in extended trading.

“If you look at the case count, the case counts are climbing in Western Europe. They’re climbing in the United States. And so there’s still a sufficient level of uncertainty out there… we don’t believe that’s an environment to guide into,” Apple CEO Tim Cook told CNBC’s Josh Lipton. 

Apple hasn’t offered guidance for the past two quarters because of uncertainty related to the Covid-19 pandemic. 

However, Cook said that he was optimistic about iPhone 12 sales for a number of reasons, including 5G support, carrier promotions, and a loyal install base, and said that “initial data points are really quite good.”

iPhone revenue was down over 16% from the same quarter last year and came up short against Wall street expectations. However, many investors and analysts are more focused on how the iPhone 12 will sell in the coming year. Apple’s iPhones went on sale this year in October, and more models are planned for next month, meaning that sales from the new devices aren’t counted in this quarter.

Revenue for Macs and iPads both exceeded analyst expectations, most likely driven by strong work-from-home trends during the pandemic. Apple drew attention to strong results in those categories last quarter, too. Overall, Mac revenue was up 29% year-over-year and iPad revenue rose 46% from the same quarter last year. 

Sales in China were a weak point for Apple. Sales in greater China, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, dropped to $7.95 billion from $11.13 billion a year before, over a 28% decrease.

“A larger percentage of China revenue is made up of new iPhones. And so that’s the reason the number for the total quarter started with a minus sign. But given what we see in the early going with the new iPhones, we’re confident we’ll grow in Q1,” Cook told CNBC.

Apple released new Apple Watch Series 6 models that went on sale in September. The category that those devices are counted in for sales is called Wearables, Home, and Accessories, which came in slightly higher than expectations. The category also includes sales from headphones such as AirPods and Beats. Sales for the category were up over 20% on a year-over-year basis.

1444,1444,2020-10-29,"Netflix hiking his $13/mo plan to $14/mo  

Netflix (NASDAQ:[NFLX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NFLX?source=news_body_link)) has jumped 3.7% as it's set to implement an expected U.S. price increase, [bumping its most popular standard plan to $14/month](https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/29/21540346/netflix-price-increase-united-states-standard-premium-content-product-features?source=news_body_link).

That's a dollar higher than its current $13 plan.

Accordingly  it's also moved its premium subscription (which allows for ultra  high-definition quality and four simultaneous streams) to $18/month. The  lowest tier is set to stay at $9/month.

The  new prices kick in immediately for new subscribers, while existing subs  will see the higher prices roll in with their billing cycles in coming  weeks.

Netflix raises prices on a  country-by-country basis, and says the hikes don't affect each other.  But observers who track the pace of increases were expecting Netflix  might act to raise U.S. prices early in 2021.

The  increase was signaled during last week's earnings call, when COO/Chief  Product Officer Greg Peters said ""You heard from Ted \[Sarandos\] the  number of original productions we're doing, increasing even under these  conditions ... if we do that, we feel like there is that opportunity to [occasionally go back and ask, for members where we've delivered that extra value in those countries to pay a little bit more](https://seekingalpha.com/news/3624015-netflix-call-subs-dipped-expected-production-full-steam-ahead-updated?source=news_body_link).""

A rise to $14/month puts Netflix's most popular  plan almost at parity with HBO Max ($15/month) - which launched at a  price point that some observers thought might be too much for a  streaming service.

1446,1446,2020-10-30,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, October 30, 2020 **PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, October 30, 2020**

The stock market fell sharply today, erasing yesterday’s gains to close out one of the worst weeks and worst month since March. Volatility has dominated markets in the last few weeks, with investors spooked by the uncertainty of the US presidential elections, a record number of coronavirus infections in the US and Europe, and a new wave of lockdowns across Europe.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) performed the worst, ended the day 2.54% down, the S&P 500 (SPY) ended the day 1% down, and the Dow Jones (DIA) 0.52% down.

Yesterday after-hours, heavily-weighted tech companies, like Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN) Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Facebook (FB) reported their quarterly earnings. Though most reported third-quarter results that exceeded expectations, shares of these companies (except Alphabet) pulled back steeply today. After the strong performance of these stocks compared to the broader market this year, market participants had set their expectations exceptionally high. In other words, traders expected these companies to beat expectations by a much greater margin than they did. The earnings results for all these companies can be found in yesterday’s issue of the daily recap. 

Today, the Federal Reserve announced it lowered the minimum loan size for its Main Street lending program to $100,000 from $250,000 and that “fees have been adjusted to encourage the provision of these smaller loans”. Demand for the lending program has been weak thus far, with the Fed having offered just 400 loans totaling $3.7 billion, out of the total $600 billion capacity. As many pundits have pointed out, many small- and mid-sized businesses have stayed on the sidelines from taking on more loans that they would eventually need to pay back during the pandemic.

Unfortunately, according to data from Johns Hopkins University, there were 88,521 new coronavirus infections reported in the US yesterday, another record, and 9,540 more cases than were reported Wednesday. The trend this week is worrying, given that only last Friday, the US set its previous record for daily new infections. According to the Washington Post, The total number of infections reported nationwide since February is virtually guaranteed to reach 9 million on Friday, just 15 days after the tally hit 8 million. At least 228,000 deaths have been linked to the coronavirus in the country.

Europe is in the thralls of a second surge in coronavirus, with the continent now accounting for 46% of global cases and nearly a third of total deaths. According to World Health Organization (WHO) Spokesperson Dr. Margaret Harris, compared to last week, daily cases in Europe have risen by “about a third” and daily deaths by “close to 40%” this week. This month, both France and Spain have declared states of emergency, imposing more restrictions to try to ease up pressure on hospital ICU departments. In France, the worst-hit country, more than half of ICU beds are occupied by COVID-19 patients, according to the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.

Today is the last Friday before the US presidential election on Tuesday. Regardless of political leanings, the results of this election are sure to have a massive effect on the stock market, it’ll be interesting to see how markets react to whatever the US decides.

* Quarterly Sales Growth > 25% YoY
* Quarterly Earnings Growth > 25% YoY
* Pre+After Tax Margins >20% Recent Quarters
* ROE >17%
* Annual Earnings Ests for the next year > 25%

And above all else you want the stock to have a great story- A new and innovative product or service  that changes how we work live or play. Not every TML will have all of these criteria, but in general their record should be outstanding with regards to most of them. The higher these values the better. Earnings and Sales growth over 100% YoY is ideal. Annual Estimates for next year over 100% would be exceptional.

TMLs are also often in the Top 20 Industry groups at the times of their runs. The TML is the leader of an overall top group which is riding the tailwinds of changing environments. Recent examples $SE $SHOP $AMZN Retail-Internet and $TSLA $NIO Electric Vehicles (Auto Manufacturers)

Additionally base liquidity is required for these stocks to be institutional quality. Dollar Volume > $30 Million is essential and most should have DV much higher than that. Accumulation by big hedge funds and mutual funds like Fidelity Contrafund are what move the markets. They won't touch a promising stock unless it has liquidity.

**Now for Technical (Price Action) Characteristics of TMLs.**

They should be:

* Above a Rising 30 Week Moving Average
* Breaking out of a Stage 1 or Stage 2 Base
* Trending above Key Moving Averages (10, 21ema, 50sma)
* Volume and Price contractions within bases
* Up/Down Vol> 1.2
* Huge gaps up on volume after Earning Beat
* And most importantly they must be showing Relative Strength, meaning they are outperforming the vast majority of stocks in the market. This. is. vital.

During corrections and overall market weakness they should be near all time highs, above their longer term moving averages.  They should be standing out like a sore thumb and yelling ""Buy me"".  And during Market Uptrends they should be trending above the shorter term moving averages, forming sideways price shelfs during small pullbacks and then breaking out again. Most stay above their 50 SMAs and even 21 emas for extended periods of time.

**So how to scan for them:**

Use MarketSmith, the IBD Stock Screener, Finviz, or another screener and screen for the fundamental criteria mentioned above combined with the stock over the 200+50 SMA.  It's helpful to have multiple screens splitting up the criteria for instance one scan for the earnings and one for sales.

1452,1452,2020-11-07,"Berkshire Hathaway buys back $9B in stock in Q3   

Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:[BRK.B](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BRK.B?source=news_body_link)) (NYSE:[BRK.A](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BRK.A?source=news_body_link)) [bought back \~$9B of stock during Q3](https://seekingalpha.com/pr/18075672-berkshire-hathaway-inc-news-release?source=news_body_link), bringing the nine-month total to \~$16B.

That's up from the $5.1B of stock the conglomerate bought in Q2.

Q3 operating earnings of $5.48B vs. $5.51B in Q2 and $8.07B in the year-ago quarter.

The only major business segment to see a Y/Y  increase in operating earnings was railroad, utilities and energy, while  insurance underwriting posted a loss vs. a year-ago profit. (updated at  8:18 AM).

Losses and costs associated with COVID-19  negatively hurt its commercial insurance and reinsurance underwriting  results; furthermore, future judicial rulings and regulatory and  legislative actions relating to insurance coverage and claims may affect  future results.

""Our underwriting results for the remainder of  2020 and the first quarter of 2021 for certain business may be adversely  affected from lower premiums attributable to credits granted to  policyholders and where premiums are a function of the insured’s  payroll,"" the company said in its 10-Q.

Operating earnings by segment:

* Insurance underwriting: loss of $213M vs. earnings of $440M a year ago.
* Insurance - investment income: $1.02B vs. $1.48B a year ago.
* Railroad, utilities and energy: $2.74B vs. $2.64B a year ago.
* Other businesses: $2.35B vs. $2.46B a year ago;
* Other: loss of $412M vs. earnings of $1.05B a year ago.

&#x200B;

Q3 net earnings of $30.1B vs. $26.3B in Q2 and  $16.5B a year ago; investment gains fell to $24.8B vs. $31.0B in Q2 and  rose from $8.7B a year ago.

Insurance float was \~$135B at Sept. 30, 2020, vs. \~$131B at June 30, 2020.

[ The company had \~$145.7B of cash, equivalents and short-term investments as of Sept. 30](https://berkshirehathaway.com/qtrly/3rdqtr20.pdf?source=news_body_link), 2020, just under the $146.6B it had at June 30.

About 70% of Berkshire's  investments in equities securities' aggregate fair value at Sept. 30  was concentrated in four companies with Apple (NASDAQ:[AAPL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL?source=news_body_link)) by far the biggest, at $111.7B. The others are Bank of America (NYSE:[BAC](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BAC?source=news_body_link)) at $24.9B, Coca-Cola (NYSE:[KO](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KO?source=news_body_link)) at $19.7B, and American Express (NYSE:[AXP](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AXP?source=news_body_link)) at $15.2B.

At Dec. 31, 2019, its investments in those four  companies represented 60% of aggregate fair value — $73.7B for AAPL,  $33.4B for BAC, $22.1B for KO and $18.9B for AXP.

Digging further down into Berkshire's 10-Q filing  and the company's unit results, its railroad, BNSF saw earnings before  income taxes slip to $1.78B vs. $1.94B in Q3 2019, primarily due to  lower volumes because of the pandemic.

Berkshire Hathaway Energy's earnings before income taxes increased to $1.12B from $1.06B a year earlier.

Manufacturing earnings before income taxes fell to  $2.26B from $2.48B, and service and retailing earnings before income  tax increased to $779M from $639M.

McLane Company saw earnings before income taxes nearly double Y/Y to $96M from $50M.

**TLDR:**

In one sentence a TML is an institutional quality stock in a leading industry group with superior fundamentals and technicals. These are monster stocks which over the course of weeks and months increase +100% to +5,000% . These stocks are disruptors which change how we work, live, or play.

TMLs are popular with traders/investors whose methodology is based on the CANSLIM system developed by William O'Neil. He called them Model Book Stocks. Huge winners worth studying to identify common characteristics that they all share O'Neil studied over 1000 model book stocks going back to the 1880s. Many are shown and discussed in these must read books

* Monster Stocks: How They Set Up, Run Up, Top and Make You Money , John Boik
* The Lifecycle Trade: How to Win at Trading IPOs and Super Growth Stocks, Eric Krull, Kathy Donnelly, and Kurt Dail

**So what are the Fundamental characteristics of a TML? You want to see superior:**

* Quarterly Sales Growth > 25% YoY
* Quarterly Earnings Growth > 25% YoY
* Pre+After Tax Margins >20% Recent Quarters
* ROE >17%
* Annual Earnings Ests for the next year > 25%

And above all else you want the stock to have a great story- A new and innovative product or service that changes how we work live or play. Not every TML will have all of these criteria, but in general their record should be outstanding with regards to most of them. The higher these values the better. Earnings and Sales growth over 100% YoY is ideal. Annual Estimates for next year over 100% would be exceptional.

TMLs are also often in the Top 20 Industry groups at the times of their runs. The TML is the leader of an overall top group which is riding the tailwinds of changing environments. Recent examples $SE $SHOP $AMZN Retail-Internet and $TSLA $NIO Electric Vehicles (Auto Manufacturers)

Additionally base liquidity is required for these stocks to be institutional quality. Dollar Volume > $30 Million is essential and most should have DV much higher than that. Accumulation by big hedge funds and mutual funds like Fidelity Contrafund are what move the markets. They won't touch a promising stock unless it has liquidity.

**Now for Technical (Price Action) Characteristics of TMLs.**

They should be:

* Above a Rising 30 Week Moving Average
* Breaking out of a Stage 1 or Stage 2 Base
* Trending above Key Moving Averages (10, 21ema, 50sma)
* Volume and Price contractions within bases
* Up/Down Vol> 1.2
* Huge gaps up on volume after Earning Beat
* And most importantly they must be showing Relative Strength, meaning they are outperforming the vast majority of stocks in the market. This. is. vital.

During corrections and overall market weakness they should be near all time highs, above their longer term moving averages. They should be standing out like a sore thumb and yelling ""Buy me"". And during Market Uptrends they should be trending above the shorter term moving averages, forming sideways price shelfs during small pullbacks and then breaking out again. Most stay above their 50 SMAs and even 21 emas for extended periods of time.

**So how to scan for them:**

1454,1454,2020-11-10,"Pandemic 'stay at home stocks' like Peloton, Zoom, Roku tank on Pfizer vaccine news—is it an overreaction? Pfizer on Monday morning [announced that its experimental COVID-19 vaccine](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine-114500360.html), developed in partnership with BioNTech, was more than 90% effective in studies and that it could distribute 50 million doses before the end of this year, and 1.3 billion doses in 2021.

The good news immediately sent [U.S. markets broadly higher](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/election-2020-stock-market-news-updates-november-9-2020-231320807.html)—especially airline stocks, energy names, bank stocks, in-person entertainment like theme parks, and real estate—except for a slew of key names that have seen huge gains during the pandemic, boosted by prolonged work-from-home trends.

Those “stay-at-home stocks” were hit hard.

Peloton ([PTON](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PTON/)) fell by as much as 25%; Logitech ([LOGI](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LOGI/)) fell 19%; Zoom Video ([ZM](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ZM/)) dropped 17%; CrowdStrike ([CRWD](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CRWD/)) fell 11%; Chewy ([CHWY](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CHWY/)) fell 10%; Roku ([ROKU](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ROKU/)) sunk 7%; Netflix ([NFLX](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NFLX/)) fell 6%; Slack ([WORK](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/WORK/)) was down 4%.

The market thinking appears to be: a widely available vaccine will prompt a return to normalcy, which will mean the end of the hockey-stick run for products and services you use in your home.

But that reductive logic doesn’t apply equally well to every stay-at-home name. Rather, the post-pandemic prospects for each business have to be examined on a case-by-case basis.

## Remote work won’t abruptly end with a vaccine

Since early on in the pandemic, analysts and experts have predicted that some form of [remote work](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/how-a-remote-work-boom-will-affect-salaries-jobs-and-where-people-live-190344317.html) is here to stay—after all, it was a trend already growing before the pandemic. If that’s the case, then many companies are going to continue to use enterprise tools like Zoom and Slack, even once offices reopen. Whether workers are in their office or at home, teams that use Slack aren’t going to just stop using it.

In Zoom’s case, the stock has also become extremely expensive. It trades at more than 800 times earnings, so it was arguably due for a big correction. The vaccine news provided an excuse for firms to take some profit and move into other names, like the battered stocks set to take off now that a vaccine is imminent. (As for Slack, increased competitive threat from Microsoft Teams is also contributing to its slide.)

The same “here to stay” thinking with the enterprise names can apply broadly to streaming services like Netflix and Roku: just because people might return to their offices doesn’t mean they will stop streaming at home.

In Roku’s case, the dip makes a little more sense, since Roku relies on ad revenue from ads on its home screen, and advertisers might indeed shuffle their budgets away from Roku if they think time spent on streaming will drop significantly. For Netflix, which makes its revenue from subscriptions (it doesn’t sell ad space or sell user data), the stock dive would only make sense if you think a significant number of subscribers will cancel Netflix after the pandemic.

Peloton is its own case: the exercise-bike company took off early in the pandemic amid staggering demand for its bikes, creating wait times of 5-10 weeks on orders. As the stock surged, some analysts warned of a “pull-forward in demand,” the idea that Peloton cannot sustain this level of sales and would be punished later on because shareholder expectations would get too high. But in its [fourth-quarter earnings report in September](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/peloton-new-highs-q4-earnings-and-revenue-202044922.html), Peloton had its first profit and showed massive continued demand for its bikes, making the bear case look wrong. (Meanwhile, Netflix, in contrast, actually did see in Q3, and explicitly identified, a [pull-forward in demand from the first half of 2020 that hurt its subscription adds](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/netflixs-q-3-demonstrates-the-dreaded-pandemic-pullforward-in-demand-193405344.html).) Once gyms fully reopen across the country, will Peloton bike sales really dry up?

On the other hand, Peloton stock, like Zoom, got extremely expensive (trading at a 15x P/E ratio), so it was due for a correction as soon as there was any indication that the end of the pandemic is in sight.

## Buy online, pick up in store

One good example of a trend accelerated by the pandemic that is generally expected not to reverse is e-commerce and the rise of BOPIS (buy online, pick up in store) for brick-and-mortar retail.

[Walmart, Target, Best Buy](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walmart-and-target-huge-ecommerce-gains-are-a-blaring-siren-to-brickandmortar-retail-192709224.html), Urban Outfitters, [Restoration Hardware](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-restoration-hardware-stock-is-up-240-during-the-pandemic-180244236.html), and [Dick’s Sporting Goods](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dicks-sporting-goods-is-wildly-outperforming-amid-the-pandemic-195504143.html) are just some of the physical retail names seeing enormous e-commerce gains, so much so that the share of U.S. retail spending attributed to e-commerce has surged to 16.1%, up from 10.8% one year ago.

Those chains have also seen [huge customer adoption of curbside pickup](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/curbside-pickup-is-exceptionally-sticky-and-will-continue-postpandemic-mc-kinsey-retail-expert-183712446.html). Dick’s Sporting Goods president Lauren Hobart said in August that Dick’s “anticipated originally that we would see a large drop-off \[in curbside\] when the stores reopened, but that is not the case.” Many retail analysts predict that even after the pandemic, consumers will stick with their new behavior and shop online, for home delivery or curbside pickup.

Whole Foods CEO [John Mackey disagrees](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/whole-foods-ceo-does-not-think-online-grocery-will-remain-the-norm-postpandemic-food-is-different-175009302.html)—he thinks some people will stick to online ordering, but that it won’t remain the norm for most. Even if he’s right, what that creates is a hybrid landscape for physical retail and physical grocery.

The same applies to remote work: even if a large number of workers return to the office, many more workers than before the pandemic are going to keep working from home, which should be good for enterprise names like Zoom, Slack, and CrowdStrike.

Wharton professor Mauro Guillen writes in his new book, “2030: How Today’s Biggest Trends Will Collide and Reshape the Future of Everything,” that beyond the pandemic we should expect a “hybrid model” of working that allows for remote-work a few days a week, and continued automation of service warehouses.

“Most of what I hear from companies right now is that we're going to go to a hybrid model,” [Guillen told Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/whartons-mauro-guillen-trends-shape-203000781.html) in August. “So, a majority of American employees who are working from home now, they're saying, ‘Yes, I would like to have a remote component in my work week, but I would like to also go to the office.’”

Logitech CEO Bracken Darrell sounds a similar tune. He insists that the recent sales boom for Logitech’s computer accessories [can’t be totally chalked up the pandemic, but to four “secular” shifts](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/logitech-ceo-4-trends-are-driving-our-sales-boost-not-just-the-pandemic-141208902.html): “One is video going everywhere, whether it’s offices or webcams. The second one is the rise of gaming as a professional sport, and as a bigger and bigger spectator sport; it’ll be the biggest collection of sports in the world one day. The third one is working from anywhere. The fourth is everybody creating their own content and streaming it, which lends itself well to our microphones. All four of those are long-term secular trends.”

But of course, Darrell has to hope so for his business. The other companies labeled “stay at home names” during the pandemic are all hoping their momentum continues, even once we get a vaccine.

1459,1459,2020-11-14,"[TSLA vs. Other EVs] Why Do Happy TSLA Investors Cheat on Lord Musk with Other Shitty EV Stocks in their unrelenting search for more tendies? Listen up you retards. 

Some of you have been enjoying a fling or two with the exotic foreigners like NIO, Li Auto, XPeng, SOLO, etc. Sure, you are a tall retard. You are just attracted to small, cute EV cars (or in the case of SOLO, retarded looking small Canadian EV with 3 wheels). They happen to be Asian but no, you don’t have a yellow fever or some kind of Asian fetish.

You retards often underestimate the emotional and financial ramifications of your actions. Papa Musk has been good to you. TSLA has made you lots of tendies in the past. But today, we are going to look into why happily invested retards like you cheat on TSLA and why that’s a mistake.

**NIO’s been making me shit load of money. I am never going back to Papa Musk**

I know it’s difficult to learn your lessons when you are retarded, but haven’t we gone through this before? You don’t bet against Papa Musk. You tried with NKLA and thought that talent-less hack Trevor Milton was some kind of second coming of messiah until you saw that fake ass video of their truck “rolling down the hill”.

Now I am seeing that you moved onto William Li. Sure, the guy is no Trevor Milton. He seems to have the right background (i.e. education, past track record as an entrepreneur, etc). He also has right investors in NIO, such as Tencent, Temasek, Baidu, Sequoia, Lenovo and TPG. But Musk already has his trump card called Model Y and I will explain to you what will happen over the next 12 months or so.

**Chinese EV Demand**

According to Barrons, China started to crack down on gasoline cars few years back. Due to congestions and pollution in the major cities, Chinese government started limiting the issuance of license plates in China. Not only is it difficult to obtain license plates for gasoline cars (i.e. it’s almost like a lottery system), the cost to obtain one is more expensive. Then let’s say somehow you were able to obtain a license plate and was able to afford one, there is another layer of complication: you can only drive gasoline cars on certain days of the week.

But with EVs, the government makes it much easier to get an EV plate than gas plate. There is better parking, less tolls, and no restriction on driving days. This is shifting the demand to EVs because the process is much easier to obtain a plate for EVs and overall cost of ownership is lower. 

**Model Y’s Importance**

Some of you ungrateful retards may have been disappointed by the announcements from the last Battery Day. But Papa Musk, did give you updates on the future of the battery technology (which will be covered on a separate rant), but more importantly on Model Y.

Per Bloomberg, Tesla’s Chinese version of the Model Y, which will be locally made in China, will be a single biggest threat to NIO’s growing dominance in the electric SUV segment of the Chinese EV market over the next 12 months.

NIO was doing superbly lately but on Friday, Citron Research released a bearish report on NIO that increased competition from TSLA will become more intense with the launch of Model Y in China.

The biggest advantage will be the price point. When Model Y is released in China (manufacturing will begin in 2021 and delivery also expected in 2021), Papa Musk said he will lower the price to $41,000 (vs. $49,900 in US). Papa Musk also said that monthly Model Y sales will reach 30k units. 

In comparison, NIO’s ES6 SUV starts at $54,000. When it comes to economy of scale, NIO is unable to match TSLA (yet) and as result, TSLA will be able to sell their Model Y at a lower price point, which will force NIO (and others) to accept a wave of price cuts to their premium electric vehicle lineup. That means while TSLA keeps printing profit and increase their revenue, the rest will have to eat the loss until they can scale up as well. (But by then, Musk will be on another money making innovation, the Battery).

**So what does this mean over the next 12 months?**

Just a week ago, Tesla registered its Model Y with the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. This indicates the start of production in China (upon issuance of final production permit for Model Y from the government). Yes. Papa Musk said production will begin in early 2021 but it looks like he’s ahead of schedule.

Additionally, there are reported sightings of Tesla doing road tests of its Model Y in China. 

NIO, which competes in the luxury segment of the EV market in China, recently reported a new monthly sales record earlier this year, delivering 3,740 vehicles in a month. 

That’s right retards. For anyone who wants to argue that NIO will catch up to Tesla soon and match its scale, that isn’t going to happen anytime soon. Tesla can deliver 3,740 vehicles in its sleep. From the get-go, Papa Musk is shooting for 30,000 vehicles of monthly Model Y sales in China and that’s only Model Y volume. 

If that’s not the nail in the coffin, then consider the risky strategy that NIO is taking on its battery strategy. While Papa Musk is developing an entirely new battery technology that will last longer, and hold the charge longer, NIO chose “Battery as a Service” strategy. What is that, you ask? 

Well, one of the key battlegrounds for the success of EV market will be the ability to build and maintain a more extensive EV charging infrastructure. China and US are looking to expand its charging network (i.e. number of charging stations) and both countries are investing into this infrastructure. 

However, NIO has taken a different approach to charging, focusing on battery swaps rather than charging stations. Rather than leveraging EV charging stations (that all other EVs will use in China, including Tesla), NIO is building its own network of “battery-swap stations”. What this means is that NIO customers can only use NIO’s “battery-swap stations” where they have to buy vehicles without the battery, and instead sign up for a monthly subscription service that gives them access to battery packs depending on their needs. 

Now ask yourself. Would you rather own EV with its own battery that you can just charge wherever, or would you rather buy one without a battery, and sign up for a subscription service where you have to swap the battery at one of its swap stations?

**Conclusion: Here are the key takeaways for you retards who failed to read my rant above**

1. NIO can’t compete on scale with Tesla. They recently achieved a record monthly delivery of 3,740 vehicles while TSLA can do that in its sleep. Papa Musk is expecting monthly delivery of 30,000 units for Model Y alone.

2. Because they can’t compete on scale, Tesla can produce and sell Model Y at a lower price point. This will force Chinese EV competitors to a wave of price cuts, which will result losses for them but not TSLA.

3. Model Y is about to start production and already conducting road-tests. It is on track to launch in 2021 at $41,000 (vs. NIO which starts at $54,000)

4. NIO’s “battery as a service” subscription program is retarded.

5. Tesla will moon again in 2021 once you assholes come back to senses.

$9B, and it’s still not done???

That means the company has to be at least $180B in size, otherwise SECs 5% ownership rule would kick in(although it could receive special exemption).

Since BRK.B is not done yet, we can assume it’s a very big fish with a very large float, otherwise that stock could likely go vertical due to lack of supply of shares.

1473,1473,2020-11-23,"The Tesla Bull Case in Brief **Disclaimer**

I have no financial position in Tesla at this point in time and no interest in initiating one within the next month.

&#x200B;

# Introduction

There seems to be a strong sentiment among some that Tesla is vastly overvalued, and that the current stock price is completely unrooted in reality. I understand the viewpoint, but don't really share the belief. That's not particularly surprising as I consider myself a Tesla optimist. I decided to present in brief the case for Tesla's valuation as I understand it.

&#x200B;

# Overvalued?

Tesla's current market capitalisation appears to be grossly overvalued, especially when compared to their peers in the automotive sector as [these charts so clearly illustrate](https://preview.redd.it/gdvz8sgmpz061.png?width=1045&format=png&auto=webp&s=45524ed08b3899febc3fa9b67329569e25a906b9).

In fact, the charts actually understate things as Tesla's market cap currently seats at around $464 billion. You could add another Daimler to the US and EU listed companies and they would still have a lower market capitalisation than Tesla.

This really is the case for Tesla being overvalued: it's automotive revenues is many times it's current market capitalisation. [Per MarketWatch, Tesla's trailing PE is 978.44](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/tsla/company-profile?mod=mw_quote_tab), so it's not as if Tesla is especially profitable either.

On a fundamentals basis, Tesla appears to be grossly overvalued.

&#x200B;

# Growth

The above chart doesn't necessarily indicate that Tesla's current market capitalisation is an extremely speculative bubble that could burst soon, but more that Tesla is not valued based on its current financial situation. Tesla is valued as an extreme growth company, and it's growth over the past five years bears this out.

**Revenue**

|Year|Revenue (USD millions)|Growth (%)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|2008|15|\-|
|2009|112|646.67|
|2010|117|4.46|
|2011|204|74.36%|
|2012|413|102.45|
|2013|2,013|387.41|

|2017|11,759|67.99|

|2019|24,578|14.52|

[Source (Macro Trends)](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TSLA/tesla/revenue)

&#x200B;

To contextualise this, here's Tesla's trailing CAGR:

|Time span|CAGR (%)|
|:-|:-|
|5 years|50.36%|
|7 years|79.27%|
|10 years|71.45%|

Over the last decade, Tesla has demonstrated formidable growth. There's reason to believe that they can continue to show impressive growth (albeit lowered going forward).

The first two quarters of 2020 were battered by a pandemic (Tesla factories faced lockdowns due to the pandemic), and as a result are somewhat of an exception. There were no lockdowns during Q3.

Looking at Tesla's Q3 results, we see that the formidable growth story continues;

||Q3 2019|Q3 2020|Growth (%)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Vehicle Deliveries|97,186|139,593|44|
|Automotive Revenues (USD millions)|5,353|7,611|42|
|Storage Deployed (MW)|477|759|59|
|Solar Deployed|43|57|33|
|Energy Revenue|402|579|44|
|Total Revenue (USD millions)|6,303|8,771|39|

&#x200B;

**Going Forward**

Wall Street seems to expect the growth story to continue. Per Market Insider, here are the consensus analyst estimates for the next five years:

|Year|Revenue (USD Millions)|Growth (%)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|2020|30,626|24.61|
|2021|44,937|46.73|
|2022|55,963|24.54|
|2023|79,620|42.27|
|2024|102,526|28.77|

[Source (Markets Insider)](https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/tsla-stock)

&#x200B;

I personally think that analyst consensus estimates are significantly underestimating Tesla's growth. In particular their figures for 2020 seem off by $2 billion or more. Analyst estimates for Q3 2020 were off by $495 million, and the estimate of $9,884M for Q4 seems off by around $1,500M (assuming Tesla meets the 180K delivery target) without accounting for the recognition of any deferred revenue. Tesla had $1,258M in deferred revenue at the end of Q3.

This may seem optimistic, but you're welcome to hold me to do this on January 28th 2021.

Despite their (potential) underestimation of Tesla, analysts expect a 5 year CAGR in 2024 of 33%. Tesla is expected to continue to show formidable growth to the end of the decade.

&#x200B;

**Expansion**

Tesla would execute on this formidable growth story through capital expenditure. They will build numerous service centres and gigafactories. The goal is to have giga factories on all 6 economic continents (with some continents having several factories) in order to lower the expenses involved in distributing the cars and to streamline logistics. Currently, Tesla is building two new gigafactories in Berlin and Austin and is currently expanding Giga Shanghai.

An inherent assumption is that the market has the demand to absorb all this extra supply. M[any states have committed to phasing out ICE vehicles](https://preview.redd.it/jpi7br8rpz061.png?width=1012&format=png&auto=webp&s=e6524f0cf77a69a52009011eff2160b34c2c1d8e).

[Source (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase-out_of_fossil_fuel_vehicles#Countries_and_large_jurisdictions)

&#x200B;

Around 13 states have committed to phasing out ICE vehicles on or before 2030. Over the coming decade, [the EV total addressable market is projected to grow to 27 million by 2030](https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/electric-vehicle-market-209371461.html#:~:text=The%20Electric%20Vehicles%20Market%20is,is%20from%202019%20to%202030) (at a CAGR of 21%). This again seems a bit too conservative. [EV sales were down in the first half of 2020 (due to the pandemic), but in July sales grew 77% YoY](https://www.ev-volumes.com/). Some states have also pulled forward their timelines for phasing out fossil fuels since the forecast was initially made.

Tesla would face stiff competition going forward, but the total addressable market would grow fast enough to absorb all of Tesla's growth in supply if they can successfully market their vehicles. The risk here is that Tesla would fail to execute not that the total addressable market isn't large enough.

As an optimist, I'm fine betting on Tesla's ability to execute.

&#x200B;

**Access to Capital**

To fund the massive expansion expected of them, Tesla would need to spend a lot on capital expenditure. Fortunately, access to capital is not a problem for Tesla.

* Tesla's cash on hand at the end of Q3 2020 was $14.5 billion.
   * Per [their 10Q filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data//1318605/000156459020047486/tsla-10q_20200930.htm) this is already sufficient to fund their capex needs up to 2023.
* Free cash flow for the quarter was $1,395M.
* Giving their current market capitalisation ($464 billion) and the mandatory demand from index funds on their inclusion ($60 billion), Tesla has an opportunity to raise $10 - $20 billion in a new capital raise.
   * A $20 billion raise would give them enough cash on hand at the end of 2020 to finance their expansion plans for several years going forward.
* Free cash flow is expected to rise going forward:
   * In Q3 there was a 234% increase QoQ and a 276% increase YoY.
   * Tesla has been seeing increased efficiency of capital expenditures.

&#x200B;

# Margins

Another component of the Tesla bull case is that in addition to hyper growth in revenues, Tesla's profit margins would also rise significantly over the next decade. [This is readily apparent if we look at Tesla's past four quarters](https://preview.redd.it/qygtw9twpz061.png?width=1202&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f6950e6e813a92b1743b89fc56ab8247129fd8d).

[Source (Tesla Investor Relations)](https://tesla-cdn.thron.com/static/4E7BR9_TSLA_Q3_2020_Update_P0Q85U.pdf?xseo=&response-content-disposition=inline%3Bfilename%3D%22TSLA-Q3-2020-Update.pdf%22)

&#x200B;

Automotive gross margins have steadily risen from 22.8% a year ago to 25.4% last quarter and seem set to continue their upwards trajectory. Total gross margins have risen from 18.9% to 23.5%. There are good reasons to expect the rise to continue and maybe even accelerate going forward:

* Manufacturing Efficiencies
* Network Services

&#x200B;

**Manufacturing Efficiencies**

As Tesla continues to ramp up production and innovate, they will be able to drive down the manufacturing cost of their vehicles, benefit even further from economies of scale (both in their production and their supply lines as EV demand heats up globally). Tesla's capital expenditure will become even more efficient; they will be able to squeeze out more manufacturing capacity, from the same amount of capital expenditures.

[Tesla's rise in capex efficiency is apparent when you compare their capex expenditure in 2020 (construction of Giga Berlin, Giga Texas, Fremont Model Y ramp, and expansion of Giga Shanghai) to capex expenditure in 2017 (Fremont Model 3 ramp)](https://preview.redd.it/7r2b1vd0qz061.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=2688cee4dc6abdb063a5ee431dc0193792aedc2b).

[Source (Hypercharts)](https://hypercharts.co/tsla)

&#x200B;

[Despite the lower capex in 2020, Tesla is building a lot more cars](https://preview.redd.it/0xw1tgc3qz061.png?width=752&format=png&auto=webp&s=21dd52a5121fdee3102afe62cb7aa9a7b3aee89b).

[Source (Statista)](https://www.statista.com/statistics/715421/tesla-quarterly-vehicle-production/)

&#x200B;

In addition to the aforementioned favourable trends, there are concrete reasons to expect Tesla to perform very well on the capex efficiency front over the next decade. A[t Tesla's battery day, Tesla laid out a roadmap to drastic increases in efficiency](https://preview.redd.it/uujqxx1jqz061.png?width=1942&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea32aa9410a4110984fcce8c32a401b260d63124).

[Source (Tesla Investor Relations)](https://tesla-share.thron.com/content/?id=96ea71cf-8fda-4648-a62c-753af436c3b6&pkey=S1dbei4)

&#x200B;

Tesla is forecasting a **69%!!!** increase in capex efficiency in the coming years.

Furthermore, the cost of batteries is forecast to fall by as much as **56%**. Batteries are a significant component of the total cost, and the reduction in the cost of batteries would further improve Tesla's margins.

Aside from batteries, and capex efficiency, Tesla should also be able to drive down the cost of manufacturing other components of their electric cars due to [Wright's Law](https://ark-invest.com/wrights-law/).

While Tesla would pass on some of these cost savings to the consumer, they wouldn't pass on all of them. This is evidenced by Tesla's improved margins in 2020 despite several price cuts.

&#x200B;

**Network Services**

Tesla's network services are included with their automotive revenues, but represent a novel high margin business that isn't part of the traditional automotive playbook. Using Tesla's fleet as the platform, Tesla can sell software products, subscriptions and other services to their customers. The recurring revenue of subscriptions in particular is a cause for optimism (especially given the potential high margins).

Tesla's existing products:

* Software
   * Full Self Driving: $10,000
   * Enhanced Autopilot: $4,000
      * This isn't currently available was previously an option
   * Acceleration Boosts
      * Model 3: $2,000
      * Model Y: $2,000
* Subscriptions
   * Premium Connectivity: $10/month
   * Full Self Driving: ???
      * Reportedly coming soon
* Miscellaneous
   * Supercharging

Tesla has only a few such products now, but they would likely develop more such products in time. Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas referred to this as ""the internet of cars"".

&#x200B;

# Beyond Traditional Automotive Revenues

It's a common statement among Tesla bulls that Tesla is not just an automaker. In my experience sceptics tend to be annoyed by this and (rightly) point out that the supermajority of Tesla's revenue comes from traditional automotive endeavours (selling their cars). While this is true now, it's not necessarily the case 10 years from now, and there's reason to believe that traditional automotive activities may no longer constitute a majority of Tesla's revenue, and may represent an even smaller portion of Tesla's profits.

I'll cover some other businesses of Tesla's that are poised to grow over the next 10 years:

* The aforementioned Network Services
* Energy
* Ridesharing
* Insurance

&#x200B;

**Energy**

Tesla's energy business is poised to benefit substantially from the shift towards renewable power sources. In particular, Tesla's battery storage businesses stands a lot to gain. [Per the Financial Times, total energy storage capacity would grow rapidly over the coming decade to over 700 Gwh by 2030](https://preview.redd.it/wn3yw4g0wz061.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=6fb25a8c625ab3d725f2895aad4662de4271c6b9).

[Source (Financial Times)](https://www.ft.com/content/7c07e492-41eb-4488-bc34-77b9d806ed5c?shareType=nongift)

&#x200B;

The total addressable market is once again large enough to soak up hyper growth from Tesla over the next decade. Musk himself has stated that he expects Tesla's energy business to be as large as their automotive business long term (a reminder that Tesla's targeted end state is 20 million cars per year).

A refresher on Tesla Energy's available products:

* Solar
   * Tesla solar panels: $1.49/watt (after incentives)
   * Solar Roof
* Battery Storage
   * Power Wall (residential)
   * Power Pack (commercial)
   * Mega Pack (utility scale)

&#x200B;

**Ridesharing**

If Tesla can sufficiently advance their autonomy technology, they may finally be able to launch their autonomous ridesharing network. While Tesla's autonomy technology is currently not yet up to par for this application, their ongoing beta has been rapidly improving with weekly updates. The beta testers have been reporting significant improvements in capability since it was rolled out a month ago.

The bet is that Tesla would be able to reach superhuman driving capability before 2025. Their location agnostic approach would let them scale up operations much more quickly than geofenced competitors (e.g. Waymo).

&#x200B;

**Insurance**

Tesla collates extensive data regarding vehicle usage and the driving patterns of their customers. Combined with their driver assist software, Tesla should be in a privileged position regarding risk assessments for Tesla customers. Using their abundant available data, Tesla may be able to prepare the most compelling insurance package for a sizable fraction of Tesla drivers.

Tesla insurance may also have a synergistic relationship with Tesla's warranty processing and service centres. Tesla insurance customers may be offered discounts on service that wouldn't be available to customers of other insurance providers.

&#x200B;

# Expectations

For public accountability purposes, I'll register my Tesla expectations for this year, next year and 2025. I'm not a financial analyst or otherwise particularly financially savvy, so I'll keep it pretty simple. I'll report my 25% - 75% confidence interval on the following metrics:

* Vehicle deliveries
* Total revenue

&#x200B;

||25%|75%|
|:-|:-|:-|
|2020 Deliveries|160,000|200,000|
|2020 Revenue (USD millions)|30,000|36,000|
|2021 Deliveries|800,000|1,200,000|
|2021 Revenue (USD millions)|48,000|78,000|
|2025 Deliveries|3,000,000|5,000,000|
|2025 Revenue (USD millions)|135,000|350,000|

&#x200B;

The growing variation in the interquartile range is a representation of my growing uncertainty about the business.

I have neither a price target for $TSLA nor concrete expectations for its stock price [(I've said in public before that $TSLA might go to $200 before going to $600)](https://preview.redd.it/v86gdkbhyz061.png?width=873&format=png&auto=webp&s=b26af1f3c8bfdf0048c7f9977ba366dcb344c12a).

I simply believe that Tesla will demonstrate hyper growth over the next decade and have a > 10 year investment horizon, so I would be comfortable investing in $TSLA using dollar cost averaging.

&#x200B;

# Closing Remarks

Many are dubious regarding Tesla's ability to deliver on the formidable vision outlined above. There are certainly numerous risks that may challenge Tesla's ability to deliver on hyper growth. However, as mentioned above, the main challenge to the hypergrowth narrative is execution risks. Fundamentally, it's a question of if Tesla can execute on the vision presented above. Giving their formidable track record so far (and the comparatively less than impressive records of the sceptics), I'm willing to bet that they can.

&#x200B;

**Additional Disclosure**

While I have no financial position in $TSLA, I'm sort of an anomalous case. I only became interested in investing a couple of months ago, and I decided to defer any investments I would make until January 2021 to mitigate exposure to political risks. If I did have a portfolio, I'd expect $TSLA would feature in it (probably at around a 10% initial weighting).",TSLA,tesla bull case brief disclaimer financial position tesla point time interest

1474,1474,2020-11-23,"The Tesla Bull Case in Brief **Disclaimer**

I have no financial position in Tesla at this point in time and no interest in initiating one within the next month.

&#x200B;

# Introduction

There seems to be a strong sentiment among some that Tesla is vastly overvalued, and that the current stock price is completely unrooted in reality. I understand the viewpoint, but don't really share the belief. That's not particularly surprising as I consider myself a Tesla optimist. I decided to present in brief the case for Tesla's valuation as I understand it.

&#x200B;

# Overvalued?

Tesla's current market capitalisation appears to be grossly overvalued, especially when compared to their peers in the automotive sector as [these charts so clearly illustrate](https://preview.redd.it/gdvz8sgmpz061.png?width=1045&format=png&auto=webp&s=45524ed08b3899febc3fa9b67329569e25a906b9).

In fact, the charts actually understate things as Tesla's market cap currently seats at around $464 billion. You could add another Daimler to the US and EU listed companies and they would still have a lower market capitalisation than Tesla.

This really is the case for Tesla being overvalued: it's automotive revenues is many times it's current market capitalisation. [Per MarketWatch, Tesla's trailing PE is 978.44](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/tsla/company-profile?mod=mw_quote_tab), so it's not as if Tesla is especially profitable either.

On a fundamentals basis, Tesla appears to be grossly overvalued.

&#x200B;

# Growth

The above chart doesn't necessarily indicate that Tesla's current market capitalisation is an extremely speculative bubble that could burst soon, but more that Tesla is not valued based on its current financial situation. Tesla is valued as an extreme growth company, and it's growth over the past five years bears this out.

**Revenue**

|Year|Revenue (USD millions)|Growth (%)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|2008|15|\-|
|2009|112|646.67|
|2010|117|4.46|
|2011|204|74.36%|
|2012|413|102.45|
|2013|2,013|387.41|
|2014|3,198|58.87|
|2015|4,046|26.52|
|2016|7,000|73.01|
|2017|11,759|67.99|
|2018|21,461|82.51|
|2019|24,578|14.52|

[Source (Macro Trends)](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TSLA/tesla/revenue)

&#x200B;

To contextualise this, here's Tesla's trailing CAGR:

|Time span|CAGR (%)|
|:-|:-|
|5 years|50.36%|
|7 years|79.27%|
|10 years|71.45%|

Over the last decade, Tesla has demonstrated formidable growth. There's reason to believe that they can continue to show impressive growth (albeit lowered going forward).

The first two quarters of 2020 were battered by a pandemic (Tesla factories faced lockdowns due to the pandemic), and as a result are somewhat of an exception. There were no lockdowns during Q3.

Looking at Tesla's Q3 results, we see that the formidable growth story continues;

||Q3 2019|Q3 2020|Growth (%)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Vehicle Deliveries|97,186|139,593|44|
|Automotive Revenues (USD millions)|5,353|7,611|42|
|Storage Deployed (MW)|477|759|59|
|Solar Deployed|43|57|33|
|Energy Revenue|402|579|44|
|Total Revenue (USD millions)|6,303|8,771|39|

&#x200B;

**Going Forward**

Wall Street seems to expect the growth story to continue. Per Market Insider, here are the consensus analyst estimates for the next five years:

|Year|Revenue (USD Millions)|Growth (%)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|2020|30,626|24.61|
|2021|44,937|46.73|
|2022|55,963|24.54|
|2023|79,620|42.27|
|2024|102,526|28.77|

[Source (Markets Insider)](https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/tsla-stock)

&#x200B;

I personally think that analyst consensus estimates are significantly underestimating Tesla's growth. In particular their figures for 2020 seem off by $2 billion or more. Analyst estimates for Q3 2020 were off by $495 million, and the estimate of $9,884M for Q4 seems off by around $1,500M (assuming Tesla meets the 180K delivery target) without accounting for the recognition of any deferred revenue. Tesla had $1,258M in deferred revenue at the end of Q3.

This may seem optimistic, but you're welcome to hold me to do this on January 28th 2021.

Despite their (potential) underestimation of Tesla, analysts expect a 5 year CAGR in 2024 of 33%. Tesla is expected to continue to show formidable growth to the end of the decade.

&#x200B;

**Expansion**

Tesla would execute on this formidable growth story through capital expenditure. They will build numerous service centres and gigafactories. The goal is to have giga factories on all 6 economic continents (with some continents having several factories) in order to lower the expenses involved in distributing the cars and to streamline logistics. Currently, Tesla is building two new gigafactories in Berlin and Austin and is currently expanding Giga Shanghai.

An inherent assumption is that the market has the demand to absorb all this extra supply. M[any states have committed to phasing out ICE vehicles](https://preview.redd.it/jpi7br8rpz061.png?width=1012&format=png&auto=webp&s=e6524f0cf77a69a52009011eff2160b34c2c1d8e).

[Source (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase-out_of_fossil_fuel_vehicles#Countries_and_large_jurisdictions)

&#x200B;

Around 13 states have committed to phasing out ICE vehicles on or before 2030. Over the coming decade, [the EV total addressable market is projected to grow to 27 million by 2030](https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/electric-vehicle-market-209371461.html#:~:text=The%20Electric%20Vehicles%20Market%20is,is%20from%202019%20to%202030) (at a CAGR of 21%). This again seems a bit too conservative. [EV sales were down in the first half of 2020 (due to the pandemic), but in July sales grew 77% YoY](https://www.ev-volumes.com/). Some states have also pulled forward their timelines for phasing out fossil fuels since the forecast was initially made.

Tesla would face stiff competition going forward, but the total addressable market would grow fast enough to absorb all of Tesla's growth in supply if they can successfully market their vehicles. The risk here is that Tesla would fail to execute not that the total addressable market isn't large enough.

As an optimist, I'm fine betting on Tesla's ability to execute.

&#x200B;

**Access to Capital**

To fund the massive expansion expected of them, Tesla would need to spend a lot on capital expenditure. Fortunately, access to capital is not a problem for Tesla.

* Tesla's cash on hand at the end of Q3 2020 was $14.5 billion.
   * Per [their 10Q filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data//1318605/000156459020047486/tsla-10q_20200930.htm) this is already sufficient to fund their capex needs up to 2023.
* Free cash flow for the quarter was $1,395M.
* Giving their current market capitalisation ($464 billion) and the mandatory demand from index funds on their inclusion ($60 billion), Tesla has an opportunity to raise $10 - $20 billion in a new capital raise.
   * A $20 billion raise would give them enough cash on hand at the end of 2020 to finance their expansion plans for several years going forward.
* Free cash flow is expected to rise going forward:
   * In Q3 there was a 234% increase QoQ and a 276% increase YoY.
   * Tesla has been seeing increased efficiency of capital expenditures.

&#x200B;

# Margins

Another component of the Tesla bull case is that in addition to hyper growth in revenues, Tesla's profit margins would also rise significantly over the next decade. [This is readily apparent if we look at Tesla's past four quarters](https://preview.redd.it/qygtw9twpz061.png?width=1202&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f6950e6e813a92b1743b89fc56ab8247129fd8d).

[Source (Tesla Investor Relations)](https://tesla-cdn.thron.com/static/4E7BR9_TSLA_Q3_2020_Update_P0Q85U.pdf?xseo=&response-content-disposition=inline%3Bfilename%3D%22TSLA-Q3-2020-Update.pdf%22)

&#x200B;

Automotive gross margins have steadily risen from 22.8% a year ago to 25.4% last quarter and seem set to continue their upwards trajectory. Total gross margins have risen from 18.9% to 23.5%. There are good reasons to expect the rise to continue and maybe even accelerate going forward:

* Manufacturing Efficiencies
* Network Services

&#x200B;

**Manufacturing Efficiencies**

As Tesla continues to ramp up production and innovate, they will be able to drive down the manufacturing cost of their vehicles, benefit even further from economies of scale (both in their production and their supply lines as EV demand heats up globally). Tesla's capital expenditure will become even more efficient; they will be able to squeeze out more manufacturing capacity, from the same amount of capital expenditures.

[Tesla's rise in capex efficiency is apparent when you compare their capex expenditure in 2020 (construction of Giga Berlin, Giga Texas, Fremont Model Y ramp, and expansion of Giga Shanghai) to capex expenditure in 2017 (Fremont Model 3 ramp)](https://preview.redd.it/7r2b1vd0qz061.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=2688cee4dc6abdb063a5ee431dc0193792aedc2b).

[Source (Hypercharts)](https://hypercharts.co/tsla)

&#x200B;

[Despite the lower capex in 2020, Tesla is building a lot more cars](https://preview.redd.it/0xw1tgc3qz061.png?width=752&format=png&auto=webp&s=21dd52a5121fdee3102afe62cb7aa9a7b3aee89b).

[Source (Statista)](https://www.statista.com/statistics/715421/tesla-quarterly-vehicle-production/)

&#x200B;

In addition to the aforementioned favourable trends, there are concrete reasons to expect Tesla to perform very well on the capex efficiency front over the next decade. A[t Tesla's battery day, Tesla laid out a roadmap to drastic increases in efficiency](https://preview.redd.it/uujqxx1jqz061.png?width=1942&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea32aa9410a4110984fcce8c32a401b260d63124).

[Source (Tesla Investor Relations)](https://tesla-share.thron.com/content/?id=96ea71cf-8fda-4648-a62c-753af436c3b6&pkey=S1dbei4)

&#x200B;

Tesla is forecasting a **69%!!!** increase in capex efficiency in the coming years.

Furthermore, the cost of batteries is forecast to fall by as much as **56%**. Batteries are a significant component of the total cost, and the reduction in the cost of batteries would further improve Tesla's margins.

Aside from batteries, and capex efficiency, Tesla should also be able to drive down the cost of manufacturing other components of their electric cars due to [Wright's Law](https://ark-invest.com/wrights-law/).

While Tesla would pass on some of these cost savings to the consumer, they wouldn't pass on all of them. This is evidenced by Tesla's improved margins in 2020 despite several price cuts.

&#x200B;

**Network Services**

Tesla's network services are included with their automotive revenues, but represent a novel high margin business that isn't part of the traditional automotive playbook. Using Tesla's fleet as the platform, Tesla can sell software products, subscriptions and other services to their customers. The recurring revenue of subscriptions in particular is a cause for optimism (especially given the potential high margins).

Tesla's existing products:

* Software
   * Full Self Driving: $10,000
   * Enhanced Autopilot: $4,000
      * This isn't currently available was previously an option
   * Acceleration Boosts
      * Model 3: $2,000
      * Model Y: $2,000
* Subscriptions
   * Premium Connectivity: $10/month
   * Full Self Driving: ???
      * Reportedly coming soon
* Miscellaneous
   * Supercharging

Tesla has only a few such products now, but they would likely develop more such products in time. Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas referred to this as ""the internet of cars"".

&#x200B;

# Beyond Traditional Automotive Revenues

It's a common statement among Tesla bulls that Tesla is not just an automaker. In my experience sceptics tend to be annoyed by this and (rightly) point out that the supermajority of Tesla's revenue comes from traditional automotive endeavours (selling their cars). While this is true now, it's not necessarily the case 10 years from now, and there's reason to believe that traditional automotive activities may no longer constitute a majority of Tesla's revenue, and may represent an even smaller portion of Tesla's profits.

I'll cover some other businesses of Tesla's that are poised to grow over the next 10 years:

* The aforementioned Network Services
* Energy
* Ridesharing
* Insurance

&#x200B;

**Energy**

Tesla's energy business is poised to benefit substantially from the shift towards renewable power sources. In particular, Tesla's battery storage businesses stands a lot to gain. [Per the Financial Times, total energy storage capacity would grow rapidly over the coming decade to over 700 Gwh by 2030](https://preview.redd.it/wn3yw4g0wz061.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=6fb25a8c625ab3d725f2895aad4662de4271c6b9).

[Source (Financial Times)](https://www.ft.com/content/7c07e492-41eb-4488-bc34-77b9d806ed5c?shareType=nongift)

&#x200B;

The total addressable market is once again large enough to soak up hyper growth from Tesla over the next decade. Musk himself has stated that he expects Tesla's energy business to be as large as their automotive business long term (a reminder that Tesla's targeted end state is 20 million cars per year).

A refresher on Tesla Energy's available products:

* Solar
   * Tesla solar panels: $1.49/watt (after incentives)
   * Solar Roof
* Battery Storage
   * Power Wall (residential)
   * Power Pack (commercial)
   * Mega Pack (utility scale)

&#x200B;

**Ridesharing**

If Tesla can sufficiently advance their autonomy technology, they may finally be able to launch their autonomous ridesharing network. While Tesla's autonomy technology is currently not yet up to par for this application, their ongoing beta has been rapidly improving with weekly updates. The beta testers have been reporting significant improvements in capability since it was rolled out a month ago.

The bet is that Tesla would be able to reach superhuman driving capability before 2025. Their location agnostic approach would let them scale up operations much more quickly than geofenced competitors (e.g. Waymo).

&#x200B;

**Insurance**

Tesla collates extensive data regarding vehicle usage and the driving patterns of their customers. Combined with their driver assist software, Tesla should be in a privileged position regarding risk assessments for Tesla customers. Using their abundant available data, Tesla may be able to prepare the most compelling insurance package for a sizable fraction of Tesla drivers.

Tesla insurance may also have a synergistic relationship with Tesla's warranty processing and service centres. Tesla insurance customers may be offered discounts on service that wouldn't be available to customers of other insurance providers.

&#x200B;

# Expectations

For public accountability purposes, I'll register my Tesla expectations for this year, next year and 2025. I'm not a financial analyst or otherwise particularly financially savvy, so I'll keep it pretty simple. I'll report my 25% - 75% confidence interval on the following metrics:

* Vehicle deliveries
* Total revenue

&#x200B;

||25%|75%|
|:-|:-|:-|
|2020 Deliveries|480,000|520,000|
|2020 Revenue (USD millions)|30,000|36,000|
|2021 Deliveries|800,000|1,200,000|
|2021 Revenue (USD millions)|48,000|78,000|
|2025 Deliveries|3,000,000|5,000,000|
|2025 Revenue (USD millions)|135,000|350,000|

&#x200B;

The growing variation in the interquartile range is a representation of my growing uncertainty about the business.

I have neither a price target for $TSLA nor concrete expectations for its stock price [(I've said in public before that $TSLA might go to $200 before going to $600)](https://preview.redd.it/v86gdkbhyz061.png?width=873&format=png&auto=webp&s=b26af1f3c8bfdf0048c7f9977ba366dcb344c12a).

I simply believe that Tesla will demonstrate hyper growth over the next decade and have a > 10 year investment horizon, so I would be comfortable investing in $TSLA using dollar cost averaging.

&#x200B;

# Closing Remarks

Many are dubious regarding Tesla's ability to deliver on the formidable vision outlined above. There are certainly numerous risks that may challenge Tesla's ability to deliver on hyper growth. However, as mentioned above, the main challenge to the hypergrowth narrative is execution risks. Fundamentally, it's a question of if Tesla can execute on the vision presented above. Giving their formidable track record so far (and the comparatively less than impressive records of the sceptics), I'm willing to bet that they can.

&#x200B;

**Additional Disclosure**

While I have no financial position in $TSLA, I'm sort of an anomalous case. I only became interested in investing a couple of months ago, and I decided to defer any investments I would make until January 2021 to mitigate exposure to political risks. If I did have a portfolio, I'd expect $TSLA would feature in it (probably at around a 10% initial weighting).",TSLA,tesla bull case brief disclaimer financial position tesla point time interest

1477,1477,2020-11-23,"I feel some stocks in this market are going crazy. Does anyone agree? Hi there,

Hope everyone is doing okay today. I've been watching markets for years and have definitely been in tune with 2020's various twists and turns for investors. I usually conduct several hours of research before even considering investing in a stock. My usual strategy involves sticking with businesses I understand and staying away from investments I feel are clearly overpriced.

In this market, I'm noticing that certain meme stocks are king. Plug Power, Tesla, Jumia Technologies, Nikola (previously), and others have run far away from a level where many investors are comfortable making a purchase. I've also noticed that the returns of several friends and family members are absolutely trouncing the rest of the market. These individuals often conduct less than one hour of research and barely know the P/E, P/S, or business model of the stock they are trading.

Are there risks in these markets? Have we shifted to a new paradigm where everybody should just buy TSLA, PLUG etc. and just coast to retirement in 5 years? If this can continue, surely you would think that pension funds would toss those 2% bonds in the garbage and buy such securities.

Please correct me if I'm wrong on any of the above, I'm curious about people's thoughts here.

1487,1487,2020-11-29,"Wall Street Braces As Tesla Addition to S&P 500 Could Put $100 Billion Into Play  

Wall Street is bracing for Tesla Inc's (NASDAQ:TSLA) arrival to the S&P 500 Index on Dec. 18.

What Happened: The addition of the California-based automaker is expected to create challenges because of the company's size, $555 billion, and volatility. Tesla's share price jumped 40% right after the S&P 500 announcement on Nov. 16, and the addition comes at a time of pandemic-related volatility, the Wall Street Journal reports. 

Tesla is the biggest company to ever join the index, and it’ll be the sixth largest by market capitalization. 

Elon Musk’s company might put $100 billion “in motion” when added, as funds try to sell other companies’ stock to buy Tesla’s, according to WSJ.

To help ease the potential trading chaos, some Wall Street managers recommend splitting the addition “over two trading days,” something that has never happened before, WSJ notes.

Ben Inker, who manages asset allocation at investment manager GMO believes any unpreparedness might have consequences. “The people who will pay the price if S&P screws up are the investors in passive S&P,” he says.

Why It Matters: Tesla's addition to the S&P 500 also happens the same day the so-called “quadruple witching” takes place. Every last Friday of the quarter marks the day when futures and options expire at the same time, which increases the volume.

This, investors say, might help with the liquidity that day but may also increase market volatility.  ",TSLA,wall street brace tesla addition sp 500 could put 100 billion play wall street bracing tesla inc nasdaqtsla arrival sp 500 index dec 18 happened addition californiabased automaker expected create challenge company size 555 billion volatility tesla share price jumped 40 right sp 500 announcement nov 16 addition come time pandemicrelated volatility wall street journal report tesla biggest company ever join index ’ sixth largest market capitalization elon musk ’ company might put 100 billion “ motion ” added fund try sell company ’ stock buy tesla ’ according wsj help ease potential trading chaos wall street manager recommend splitting addition “ two trading day ” something never happened wsj note ben inker manages asset allocation investment manager gmo belief unpreparedness might consequence “ people pay price sp screw investor passive sp ” say matter tesla addition sp 500 also happens day socalled “ quadruple witching ” take place every last friday quarter mark day future option expire time increase volume investor say might help liquidity day may also increase market volatility,Positive,0.872
1488,1488,2020-11-30,"TSLA: Get ready to cash out from the largest ongoing pump and dump in history Ok, so TSLA will be included in S&P 500 in Dec 21. Old news. Around $100B(almost 1/5th of its market cap) of TSLA would need to be purchased(some active funds may have already purchased) based on current stock price.

The only reason I have been holding TSLA after it split is the whole S&P 500 inclusion thingy. After that, I don't know what will even move this stock. They freakin surpassed Berkshire and could surpass Facebook(for a short time)!!!

Today they will announce whether to include TSLA in two sessions or in one session.

[This is what happened when Yahoo was included(which is comparable to TSLA's inclusion as they have had relatively comparable size in comparison to S&P 500's size). Although I believe TSLA will rise again after some time, unlike Yahoo.](https://imgur.com/a/1qj22eR)

After the trading sessions, expect a big dip. As a lot of speculators this year have bought into TSLA precisely to front-run the index investors.

Also, the trade date Dec. 18, coincides with a once-quarterly event known as quadruple witching, the Friday near the end of each calendar quarter on which options and futures on both indexes and stocks expire simultaneously. Volume is usually heavy on those days and would help boost liquidity on the day of Tesla’s inclusion, investors said. (this paragraph copied straight from wsj)

So, I guess don't be a fool(unless there are some tax implications, which I don't have); buy the rumour, sell the news. TSLA will completely tank after the inclusion.

Also, remember NIO etc kind of benefit from the TSLA hype, so be very careful you all about them.

I don't think if you don't have any immediate tax implications, there wouldn't be much value holding TSLA for the longer term as there are better long term plays. And when or if TSLA reaches $700 or higher(I know I am very bullish, but that's why I am still holding it) there would be almost no point in holding it any longer.

Some special points to remember:

* TSLA already jumped 40% after its inclusion news broke out and had been steadily climbing before it due to rumour that it will be included in the index and Softbank's trade earlier this year.
* TSLA can issue more shares, especially in this valuation. I mean why wouldn't they, lol.

I know posts that say anything negative about TSLA gets downvoted but be careful about your TSLA shares or options!

I am also long PLTR(long leaps too) and some other meme stocks which I am not mentioning cause my post gets removed somehow and I am not sure why(so you know I don't give a damn about valuations, although I am kind of an early mover, so all of them are at a very profitable position).",TSLA,tsla get ready cash largest ongoing pump dump history ok tsla included sp 500 dec 21 old news around 100balmost 15th market cap tsla would need purchasedsome active fund may already purchased based current stock price reason holding tsla split whole sp 500 inclusion thingy dont know even move stock freakin surpassed berkshire could surpass facebookfor short time today announce whether include tsla two session one session happened yahoo includedwhich comparable tslas inclusion relatively comparable size comparison sp 500 size although believe tsla rise time unlike yahoohttpsimgurcoma1qj22er trading session expect big dip lot speculator year bought tsla precisely frontrun index investor also trade date dec 18 coincides oncequarterly event known quadruple witching friday near end calendar quarter option future index stock expire simultaneously volume usually heavy day would help boost liquidity day tesla ’ inclusion investor said paragraph copied straight wsj guess dont foolunless tax implication dont buy rumour sell news tsla completely tank inclusion also remember nio etc kind benefit tsla hype careful dont think dont immediate tax implication wouldnt much value holding tsla longer term better long term play tsla reach 700 higheri know bullish thats still holding would almost point holding longer special point remember tsla already jumped 40 inclusion news broke steadily climbing due rumour included index softbanks trade earlier year tsla issue share especially valuation mean wouldnt lol know post say anything negative tsla get downvoted careful tsla share option disclaimer long tsla share call option also long pltrlong leap meme stock mentioning cause post get removed somehow sure whyso know dont give damn valuation although kind early mover profitable position,Positive,0.926

Buying on solely what you hear without doing any research into sales, future growth, PE ratio, etc is bound to get you losses. You won't have gains every day. If you fold at the drop of a hat, then the stock market isn't for you. There will be bad days, but it's up to you as an investor to understand that timing the market is dang near impossible. You need to start thinking long-term if you haven't been doing so already. If you're expecting +50% gains, you're lost dude. 

This isn't r/wallstreetbets so stop saying ""yolo"" and throwing all your money into companies that you're only buying because other people are talking about it.

Don't forget that we're still in the midst of a pandemic in a country whose people turned mask-wearing into a political issue. The possibility that we undergo another lockdown isn't outlandish. 

Do research. Read, for crying out loud. Look at earnings reports. Take everything you hear with a grain of salt. Slow and steady money is much better than losses, so act like it.

According to analysis by S3 Partners, short investors in Tesla— those who placed bets in the market that its shares would lose value — have lost $35 billion on those positions so far this year.

Tesla short sellers lost $8.5 billion in November alone, as the company's shares climbed 46% in the month. That's more than the $6.7 billion Tesla itself lost in the 11 years from when it first reported results in 2008 to the end of last year. 

Dusaniwsky said many of the shorts have closed out their positions — the number of Tesla shares held by short sellers is down 63% so far this year. But he said many are still unwilling to change their minds, despite the losses.

1496,1496,2020-12-05,"Is AMZN the biggest player? I recently became very interested in outstanding shares and how the amount of shares can change for a stock over time. During the process, I charted AAPL, AMZN & MSFT for the last 15 years. I included share price, outstanding shares and assets into the charts (links below). 

All three companies experience exponential growth in their stock price as expected. What I find interesting is that Microsoft's outstanding shares have decreased in a somewhat linear fashion by roughly 30%. For Apple, outstanding shares increased slowly till around the time Steve Jobs died (figures) and then proceeds to decrease linearly for a total reduction of about 30% as well. On the contrary, AMZN has increased shares by 20% over the same period of time!

Now i'm curious what it all means?!

It's worth noting that AMZN's assets are seeing (what seems to be) exponential growth whereas microsoft is linear and apple when from a linear growth to a slight decrease for the past few years.

Is Besos creating that much more of a monster by creating shares consistently along the way so that the company has insane asset growth?

The share sale plan comes after the stock shot up 12.8% over the past three days to Monday’s record close of $641.76. That rally boosted Tesla’s market capitalization to $6.08 billion, enough to make it the sixth most valuable U.S. company.

The stock TSLA, +7.13% slid 1.8% ahead of Tuesday’s open. The stock has soared 94.4% over the past three months through Monday, and 667.1% year to date, while the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.19% has gained 14.3% this year.

Telsa said it entered into an equity distribution agreement with a number of Wall Street banks, including Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Barclays, BNP, BofA Securities, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Morgan Stanley, SG Americas and Wells Fargo.

Shares will be sold from “time to time” through an “at-the-market” (ATM) offering program.

The offering follows another $5 billion offering completed three months ago, when a large shareholder also sold off some of its stake, and before the stock is added to the S&P 500 index on Dec. 21.

Based on Monday’s stock closing price of $641.76, the offering plan could represent about 7.79 million shares, or about 0.8% of the shares outstanding.

1512,1512,2020-12-12,"The big problem with this and other 'big' subreddits - Popular stocks and funds. This will probably be downvoted because it goes against the grain of popular thought here.

The big problem with this subreddit and why you really shouldn't listen to anything here if you are new and naïve to investing is the constant jumping on bandwagons.

The reason why 90% of investors simply do not beat the market indexes is due to jumping on popular stocks and funds after they have been hyped up to stupid price levels.

Here are some examples:- Tesla- Nio- Ark funds

The reason I put Ark in their is because retail investors keep pumping ark up on every single subreddit every day. Here's the fact: It's performed very well *recently* in a 10 year bull market. It has yet to prove itself long term and investing is all about long term.

Tesla and nio are simply in EV bubbles, the EV space is similar to where the dot com was in 2000. It doesn't matter how good a company is if you are buying it for way over it's intrinsic value.

Peter lynch mentioned this in his book. Retail investors constantly switch to the best performing funds in recent years. **These funds then lagg behind the market index. Probably due to their holdings becoming overvalued compared to fundamentals.**

A lot of you guys here need to understand that. Also, just because I am a bear on these stocks/funds doesn't mean I am going to short them because that's timing the market.

Edit: It seems a lot of people agree with me here.

That brings me to 3 🚀that will 🌙 

MT - Arcelor Mittal 

They are a dual benefit buy as they mine and produce - vertically integrated.  

Their stock in June of 2008 stood at $297 - today it is $20. Facing a demand >>> supply situation not as great as we are at today. 

I expect MT stock to increase by a minimum of 300-500% in very short order.  

This is for a trade only and not long time hold. 

It will increase over the next 8-12 weeks and accelerate after earnings until supply catches up with demand and it will. 

It did and the stock dropped to $78 by October 2008.

Massive recycling play here - these are the guys that supply scrap for steel manufacturing to companies that are “mini-mill” Electric Arc Furnaces that melt steel scrap and make rebar and other steel products. 

Scrap prices just increased here in the United States by $90/ton - the largest increase since 2008. 

In May 2008 It was trading at over $100/share. 

Today it is $29/share. 

I have common and smaller option positions.

1514,1514,2020-12-14,"I used AI, behavioural economics and alternative data to create a stock market indicator For the past couple of months Ive been working on a bellwether indicator for the stock market. I used insights from behavioral economics, an alternative dataset and AI to turn this in to practice. Below I worked out the thought process behind the indicator which I wanted to share and bounce ideas off.

&#x200B;

 The thought proces behind the indicator is divided in to the three components already mentioned, a behavioural psychology part, an alternative big data part and the AI part. Or just scroll down to see the final result compared to the S&P 500.

**The psychology part**

The fact that you are more cautious when you just witnessed an accident is called availability bias in the school of behavioural finance. It describes the notion that people judge the probability of something happening more likely when an example more easily comes to mind. So for example you probably overestimate the probability of a shark attack when you have just read about in the news. You could argue that the same goes for economic principles. People are more likely to believe inflation is coming when the news is full of it. Or that a recession is coming when everyone is tweeting about it. Or that a stock is going up when its all over Reddit. Point is that news can drive the market, rather than just report or follow on it. In this respect also the recent work of Nobel Prize winner Robert Shiller is relevant. His book Narrative Economics describes how stories can propel economic events. But how can one assess what people are reading, or what news they are exposed to? This is where alternative data and AI play their part.

**The alternative data part**

Traditional finance data is usually nice to work with, it is clean, nicely structured and most data is readily available. Unfortunately that is also it’s drawback, since everyone is looking at it, it is hard to gain an edge. Alternative data however usually is instructed and messy, but it is unique. One of the largest alternative data sources is the internet. Terabytes of data are generated every minute and with this indicator we want to take advantage of that.

Therefore I created a dataset with financial news articles from well know websites, financial tweets and other sources of financial news combined to one large dataset with unstructured alternative data. With this data we can see to what news investors are exposed to. And here is the cool thing, if we think about our behavioural flaws discussed in the first part, we can make a prediction as to where investors’ availability bias is headed to. Put differently, is we know if investors are reading more negative or positive news, we can try to predict if their investment decisions will be positive (i.e. long) or if they will be negative (i.e. short). Unfortunately going through all this data and seeing for every news article, tweet etc whether it’s positive or negative is quite undoable. But here is the good news, we can let a computer do that and that is where the AI part comes in.

**The AI part**

AI is getting smarter and smarter almost daily it seems. And more importantly, big AI libraries are available to everyone with a computer running Python. Google (TensorFlow) and Facebook (PyTorch) are so kind to make their AI libraries open source, which puts some really powerful tools at the tips of your fingers. In this case we will let AI do two tasks:

\- Read headlines (ML zero shot sentiment classification)

\- Predict returns over a certain horizon

For this paper we will only discuss the first task, the next one is for another post.

To summarize the first two steps, first we discussed how people are influenced by what they read, second we showed that with alternative data we obtain what they read. The next (and hardest) part is actually reading and classifying. Since we have about 1000 daily news articles we have to let a computer to this, which we do by means of AI/Machine learning. We can use a model that is trained to classify a string of text as either optimistic (scoring it with a max of +1) to pessimistic (scoring it with a minimum of -1). How we do this is quite technical and will be explained in a different post, but the end result is a dataset of more than a million articles classified from +1 (optimistic) to -1 (pessimistic). Now the final step, checking whether the theory we proposed in the first part holds any truth when checking the data.

**Tying it all together**

So to recap, academic research shows how news can influence investor sentiment, we have alternative (big) data that contains all this news, and we have a computer that can interpret that news faster than any human can. You can check out how this graphically looks on: 

[https://www.alternative-analytics.eu/indicators/](https://www.alternative-analytics.eu/indicators/)

&#x200B;

The dashed line shows the S&P500, the other one our sentiment indicator. The vertical axis shows sentiment (negative to positive) and the horizontal axis is time. You can clearly see how sentiment was already decreasing before the market collapsed under COVID fear. Interestingly you also sentiment improving before the market recovered. So at the least we can see from that this plot that there is a relation between our indicator and S&P stock prices. This shows how new technology and improvement in AI is giving us a new way for looking at the market.",GOOG,used ai behavioural economics alternative data create stock market indicator past couple month ive working bellwether indicator stock market used insight behavioral economics alternative dataset ai turn practice worked thought process behind indicator wanted share bounce idea x200b thought proces behind indicator divided three component already mentioned behavioural psychology part alternative big data part ai part scroll see final result compared sp 500 psychology part fact cautious witnessed accident called availability bias school behavioural finance describes notion people judge probability something happening likely example easily come mind example probably overestimate probability shark attack read news could argue go economic principle people likely believe inflation coming news full recession coming everyone tweeting stock going reddit point news drive market rather report follow respect also recent work nobel prize winner robert shiller relevant book narrative economics describes story propel economic event one ass people reading news exposed alternative data ai play part alternative data part traditional finance data usually nice work clean nicely structured data readily available unfortunately also ’ drawback since everyone looking hard gain edge alternative data however usually instructed messy unique one largest alternative data source internet terabyte data generated every minute indicator want take advantage therefore created dataset financial news article well know website financial tweet source financial news combined one large dataset unstructured alternative data data see news investor exposed cool thing think behavioural flaw discussed first part make prediction investor ’ availability bias headed put differently know investor reading negative positive news try predict investment decision positive ie long negative ie short unfortunately going data seeing every news article tweet etc whether ’ positive negative quite undoable good news let computer ai part come ai part ai getting smarter smarter almost daily seems importantly big ai library available everyone computer running python google tensorflow facebook pytorch kind make ai library open source put really powerful tool tip finger case let ai two task read headline ml zero shot sentiment classification predict return certain horizon paper discus first task next one another post summarize first two step first discussed people influenced read second showed alternative data obtain read next hardest part actually reading classifying since 1000 daily news article let computer mean aimachine learning use model trained classify string text either optimistic scoring max 1 pessimistic scoring minimum 1 quite technical explained different post end result dataset million article classified 1 optimistic 1 pessimistic final step checking whether theory proposed first part hold truth checking data tying together recap academic research show news influence investor sentiment alternative big data contains news computer interpret news faster human check graphically look httpswwwalternativeanalyticseuindicatorshttpswwwalternativeanalyticseuindicators x200b dashed line show sp500 one sentiment indicator vertical axis show sentiment negative positive horizontal axis time clearly see sentiment already decreasing market collapsed covid fear interestingly also sentiment improving market recovered least see plot relation indicator sp stock price show new technology improvement ai giving u new way looking market,Positive,0.9958

I'm surprised people aren't already significantly complaining about it. Once this reaches mainstream, people will start complaining on Twitter about Facebook and Facebook will either have to suffer a loss of customers, or they will change their policies to collect less information.

There are probably smaller market cap companies that will be affected much more by this, such as ZNGA, which sells location data to advertisers and depends entirely on mobile games.

>Funds that mimic the benchmark are set to buy more than $70 billion of the carmaker’s shares and dump an equal amount of stock in existing members, producing intense selling pressure that could lead to dislocations, warned Greg Sutton, head of portfolio trading at Citadel Securities, one of the most active traders of U.S. stocks.

>The potential funding stress is one factor that had prompted the index’s overseers to consider implementing the addition in two tranches. After consulting with the financial community, S&P Dow Jones Indices decided that Tesla will join the traditional way: in one shot, before markets open on Monday. The danger is that trading in many stocks may not be active enough to absorb the sudden deluge of supply.

>“Adding it all at once creates more stock that needs to be sold for the funding trade, which potentially creates more impact -- especially in less-liquid components of the S&P 500,” Sutton said by phone. “The market can digest it, but there is the potential for liquidity impact.”

>While S&P 500 members get shuffled frequently, Tesla’s enormous size adds an unusual layer of uncertainty this time. Boasting a market capitalization of more than $600 billion, Elon Musk’s company is joining as the sixth-largest company in the index. Since the stock it’s replacing -- Apartment Investment and Management Co. -- is only a tiny fraction of Tesla’s size, all other constituents are at risk of feeling the pinch.

/

>To be sure, mammoth additions like this have happened before. Tesla is the biggest entrant by market value in history. However, when measured as a percentage of the S&P 500, its weighting is similar to Berkshire Hathaway’s in 2010, when Warren Buffett’s firm was picked to join, data compiled by Sanford C. Bernstein showed. Yet with passive investing now accounting for roughly half of equity funds, up from 30% a decade ago, the funding requirement this time will be much higher, warned analysts including Toni Sacconaghi and Ann Larson.

>Since S&P Dow Jones announced the news of Tesla’s addition on Nov. 16, the stock has rallied more than 60%. Over the stretch, about 52 million shares changed hands each day on average, 77% more than the previous month. During the past decade, the 10 biggest new entrants climbed an average 10% from the announcement until the actual inclusion, Bernstein’s analysis showed.

>Money managers may have already started adjusting portfolios in anticipation of the changes, with Tesla’s share offering earlier this month providing an opportunity to build positions.

1524,1524,2020-12-18,"Daily Market Recap - Friday, December 18, 2020 **PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, December 18, 2020**

Stocks fell Friday, one day after the Nasdaq (QQQ) and S&P 500 (SPY) recorded new intraday highs. Market participants were disappointed by the weekly unemployment report, which unexpectedly saw new jobless claims rise to the highest level since September, but remain hopeful the grim data will compel lawmakers to pass more virus-related stimulus. 

This Friday marked a quarterly event known as the quadruple witching, during which stock index futures and options, and single equity futures and options, all expire on the same day. This tends to cause trading volumes to spike. This S&P 500 is also set for a major rebalance with the index set to include Tesla, the largest company ever to be added by market cap, in the index by Monday, December 21.

On Thursday, the Labor Department also released its Weekly Unemployment report, which showed a second straight increase in the number of first-time unemployment claims. 880,000 Americans filed for new unemployment claims, much higher than the 818,000 expected. The increase in unemployment is likely a result of the new restrictions being placed throughout the country in response to the recent surge in coronavirus. 

Despite optimistic words from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, the possibility of a no-deal scenario and a partial government shutdown is still on the table. Senate Majority Whip John Thune suggested Thursday that the government could go into a partial shutdown over the weekend if lawmakers are unable to agree on the details of both the government spending bill and the virus-relief attached to it. Yesterday, McConnell said, “lawmakers made major headway toward hammering out a targeted pandemic relief” and that “we \[Senators\] have agreed we will not leave town until we’ve made law.” Hopefully, lawmakers are finally able to come together and pass additional and much-needed economic relief.

In good news, more progress was made on the vaccine front after the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) advisory panel voted to recommend that Moderna’s (MRNA) coronavirus vaccine candidate be authorized for emergency use. This would be the second inoculation to be granted emergency use authorization in the US. Pfizer’s (PFE) vaccine has already begun to be distributed across the US.

Each paycheck, Smith, a video producer, would pay his bills and then buy additional shares with the rest, ultimately putting about $90,000 into the volatile stock.

Laura Goldman, 62, says New York-based analysts missed how much appeal the company holds for a younger generation that’s deeply worried about the climate crisis. Goldman, a former stockbroker, doesn’t even own a car — let alone a Tesla.

Termanini invested in the company a few months after the June 2010 IPO and says his investment has grown to over $2.5 million, between options and stock. He has traded over the years but he’s not selling now, a decision that’s made easier by the fact that he has a diversified portfolio.

Let’s get ready to tumble! Come Monday, $TSLA enters the S&P 500, as the world is aware. This is the one you will tell your grandkids about, or at least the new crop of investors, wondering what the bubble of 2020 was like. Tesla can be your example of the insanity....1/ 

For all of the cost-saving benefits of passive investing, the Standard & Poor’s committee that actively chooses the components for its indices will prove why passive investors are the dumb money with this coming Monday’s inclusion of $TSLA into its venerable S&P 500 index. 2/ 

The committee is not known for a price consciousness. It chases what’s hot and eliminates from its august roster what’s not. 3/ 

It’s disregard for fundamentals or value was seen sharply in late 1999 & early 2000 when bubble darlings like Peoplesoft, New Century Energy, Global Crossing, Xilinx, Teradyne, Quintiles Transnational, Citrix and JDS Uniphase made their way into the index. 4/ 

Pull up the long-term charts to see how these “timely” additions fared post admittance. The most prominent additions in 1999 were America Online (discussed in my 12/5 thread) and Yahoo, whose mania also reminds me of Tesla... 5/ 

Yahoo went public in 1996, priced at $13 per share, opened at $24.50 and closed at $33 on its first trading day, a market cap of $850 million. From there the shares zoomed ahead by more than 6x in 2 years reaching $354 in January 1999. 6/ 

The company then bought Geocities for $3.6B and Broadcast for $5.7B and the stock was more than cut in half, trading down to $120. Recovering by late 1999, the wizards at S&P announced they would add Yahoo to the index on 11/30/1999. 7/ 

The stock climbed 67% from $210 on the day of the announcement to $350 on the day of its inclusion on 12/7, one week later. Sound familiar? The rollercoaster didn’t high point for another month. 8/ 

Yahoo peaked not quite a month later at a share price of $475, a market cap of $127B on January 3, 2000 (the cap didn’t include another 124 million option shares, 38M granted in 1999 alone, which implied an additional \~$50B in market cap on January 3, 2000). 9/ 

In hindsight, or for anyone with reason, which was lacking in those days, there was no need to count the fully diluted shares. Why? Those options would not be exercised. The stock fell 98.3% over the next 1 ¾ years, from $475 to $8.11 on 9/26/2001, a market cap of $2.2B. Yep. 10/ 

At the peak, Yahoo's $127B market cap compared to $600 million in trailing 12-month revenues, so 211 times revenues. 11/ 

But the Yahoo and tech bulls would get right in your face (or on the Yahoo Finance message board) and tell you, moron, that sales had grown 141%, 248%, 258% and 1,345% in the prior 4 years, which they did. 12/ 

Heck, even after the stock dropped from a STOCK PRICE of $475 to $30 (a mere 93.7% in a year for those counting) by the end of 2000, sales still GREW by 88% to $1.1B, to “only” 15 times revenues! From there, however, the company flailed. 13/ 

Sales actually fell 35%, from $1.1B to $717m from 2000 to 2001, which is what drove the shares down to $8.11 and a $2.2B market cap. To what had been the first and dominant home page, and really the dominant search engine, competition came fast. 14/ 

Yahoo even eventually outsourced its search function to upstart Google if you can believe that. Yahoo did ultimately grow its revenues another 5x to $5B by 2016, when it was bought by Verizon $VZ in 2016 for $4.5B, excluding a sub's partial investment in Alibaba. 15/ 

The buyout was at a far cry from the day Yahoo came into the S&P 500 as the 30th largest capitalization in the index, with a market cap of roughly $90B and I’d guess at a weight of 0.7%. 16/ 

At its January 3, 2000 peak, Yahoo had climbed to the #15 spot in the index, well ahead of Berkshire Hathaway $BRKA $BRKB (which was not yet in the index despite its mere $83B market cap, $131B in assets and $38B in shareholders equity.) 17/ 

Had Berkshire been in the index the day Yahoo peaked it would have held only the 37 spot, behind notorious tech darlings Cisco at $358B, Intel $290B, Time Warner $184B, Lucent $171B Sun Mico $168B, AT&T $160B, WorldCom $148B, Dell $130B, HP $120B, Oracle $120B, EMC $116B,... 18/ 

Qualcomm $116B, DirecTV $102B, Verizon $93B, AOL $93B, Motorola $90B, and Bellsouth $87B. Many of these are gone today, which leads us back to $TSLA. 19/ 

Never has the S&P 500 committee brought in a company so large by market cap as will be the case with Tesla's inclusion. Nor have they ever brought in a company at so high a spot in the cap-weighted index, at #6, one notch ahead of Berkshire Hathaway. Insanity. 20/ 

Of course, by sales & profits, plenty of companies have entered the index as larger constituents, but that’s not what counts in the passive index. It’s all about float adjusted market cap. Fundamental valuation matters not. Qualifying for index inclusion required some hijinks.21/ 

Tesla had cut R&D & SG&A, drew on reserves and leaned on environmental carbon credits to “earn” a GAAP profit for a necessary four quarters. They did so for five. Oddly, revenues only grew 15% in 2019, prior to the pandemic, in part for a reduction in customer tax incentives. 22/ 

Impressively, they have grown revenues 15% for the first 9 months of 2020 during the crisis while the incumbents saw sales decline. No doubt the business is growing. But how to value it? 23/ 

On November 16, the S&P index committee announced Tesla would be added on December 21. The market cap was $380B. Here on Saturday December 19, the stock price at $695 yields a market cap of $659B ($BRK, the current #6 is $528B) up $279B or 73% since the announcement. 24/ 

The gain matches the percentage rise seen by Yahoo during the week between its announcement & addition. The $279B gain is LARGER than the $215B market cap of the world’s largest auto manufacturer, Toyota. Tesla’s $659B cap is on 948M shares out at 9/30 (up 5% since YE 2019). 25/ 

The share count excludes another 157M unvested or unexercised option and RSU shares, which would add more than $100B to the market cap on a fully diluted basis. 26/ 

Let’s not count those for the same reason they were excluded in the Yahoo calculation. Why? Many may go unexercised. Why? Nobody in their right mind would pay $659B, $760B diluted, for a car co w/ $30B in sales, little or no economic profit and an enormous growth capital need.27/ 

25x sales? 2,030x GAAP earnings? 422x earnings assuming Toyota’s best in industry 6% profit margin? Heck, even 85 times Microsoft’s 30% profit margin (a bone for the Tesla is not a car company but also a software/robotaxi crowd). Welcome to the game, index fund investors. 28/ 

80% of Tesla’s shares float, not owned by insiders, which means the adjusted market cap weight will be $528B, compelling somewhere between $50 and $75B of direct index purchases, not to mention those needed by index huggers and closet indexers. 29/ 

The stock will come in at \~1.75% of the $30.5 trillion index, itself significantly overvalued, not unlike when Yahoo peaked in January 2000 and the index peaked at over 30x earnings and 44x cyclically adjusted (CAPE) shortly thereafter. 30/ 

What prospective return does the Tesla bull expect, or the passive investor with 1.75% of capital in the shares come Monday? At 15% a year, the market cap, assuming no further dilution, grows to $3T over the next decade, \~10% of the market value of the entire S&P 500 today. 31/ 

At “only” 10% per year, the fully diluted market cap grows to $2 trillion, almost where $AAPL is valued these days. At a 10% shareholder return, to trade at 30x earnings, Tesla will need to be earning $67 billion. 32/ 

For grins let’s assume the company actually earns some blend of auto maker profit (most earn \~3%, Toyota \~6%) and a subscription software, robotaxi margin of 30%. Generously call it a 20% blended profit margin, which I’d bet heavily against. 33/ 

At the impossible 20% margin, $67B would sit under $335B in revenues, roughly 11 times today’s run rate. Revenues will need to grow by almost 28% per year, and profits to 20% of revenues, to get to a 30x multiple on earnings. 34/ 

To finance the necessary capital stock to produce $335B in revenues will require about half that much in capital, either debt or equity. 35/ 

Car companies require roughly a dollar in capital to produce a dollar in revenues, but remember we are ""assuming"" this is a software company or whatever else hallucinogens conjure up in the minds of bulls. 36/ 

The best course of action for Tesla is to keep selling “at-the-market” blocks, with no prospectus, road show or risk warning, to the dumb money that is willing, or compelled, as is the passive crowd, to pay dangerous prices. The dilution at today’s prices is infinitesimal. 37/ 

Through the end of 2019 Tesla had sold $12.7B in shares and borrowed $16B in debt and preferred stock. Total capital raised of $28B exceeded FY 2019 revenues of $25B and produced a $6B cumulative LOSS. 38/ 

So far in 2020, Tesla has borrowed an additional net $200m and sold $12.3B of new shares (assuming a sale of the most recent $5B “at-the-market”). Bulls revere the cash on the balance sheet, but it didn’t come from profit or free cash. 39/ 

Total capital raised is now $40B before retained losses. What does Tesla earn on capital? Nothing yet. Equity is less than capital raised from stock sales by the amount of cumulative losses. Per share book is of course higher thanks to successful stock sales way above book...40/ 

From a business case and investment standpoint, the math doesn’t work. Consider that total automobiles sold worldwide peaked two years ago at about 95m passenger and commercial car and truck units. At $20,000 per new vehicle, we can call the global auto market $2T in size. 41/ 

Our example has Tesla’s market cap growing over the next decade at “only” 10% per year to a like $2T. Car companies, with the exception of Ferrari, which makes three cars per year, don’t trade for one times sales. They trade for less. 42/ 

Toyota, which earns a 6% margin and 6% on capital, trades itself at an all-time-high $215B on revenues of $280B in 2019, less in 2020. 43/ 

Auto manufacturers trade for less than sales because they make \~3% net margins and earn that same \~3% on capital and revenues grow at \~3%. We can call the industry 3x3x3 (new material here folks). The car business is a bad business, and that’s what Tesla is trying to disrupt? 44/ 

The best case for shareholders: If Tesla grows the aforementioned sales for the next decade by 28% to $335B (it won’t), the stock will trade for no more than 1x sales, because it’s a CAR company. 45/ 

If it earns Toyota’s best in class 6% margin, even allowing for software “upgrades,” it earns $20B and trades for 25x, or a $500B market cap, which is a 33% loss from here people using diluted shares. If sales, margins or the multiple are lower, shareholders lose more. 46/ 

The realistic case: The performance of the stock from here is a giant loss over time and the Tesla cult loses interest in the brand. In fact, they come to hate the brand because of their coming stock losses, customer and employee mistreatment. 47/ 

Ask the guys and gals on the S and X lines about their unpaid “break” here at quarter end. Rumor has it they can ""volunteer their time"" to help boost production before yearend. Sales grow nowhere near 28% a year. The incumbent auto manufacturers won’t roll over and play dead. 48/ 

My prior tweet elaborated on [@elonmusk](https://twitter.com/elonmusk) using his inflated shares as currency to acquire another manufacturer w/ capacity, as he mentioned he’d be up for in a friendly merger of equals. The point of that message was that the incumbents won’t take his dangerous scrip in a deal. 49/ 

That leaves Elon with having to sell new shares perpetually to finance his growth. It makes 100% sense when the shares are insanely overvalued to do so, and despite the ethics of doing so in these recent at-the-market deals. 50/ 

By contrast, Mr. Buffett points out he’d prefer new and current shareholders to have a fair experience in his company’s shares. If the auto makers won’t take them in a deal, and they shouldn’t, then that leaves new shareholders to provide growth capital. Hello passive crowd. 51/ 

We’ll see what happens after Monday, when Tesla assumes the #6 perch in the index. When the argument for passive is low fees, remind me in ten years how much of the loss in Tesla’s shares from here should be considered a “fee,” or a tax on stupidity. 52/ 

At 1.75% of the index, a decline of 80-90% would be heavy, but realistic. Impossible to decline that much? An 88% drop takes you all the way back to….where Tesla’s shares began the year. 53/ 

A 90% decline takes the cap to $66B, 2.2x current run rate revenues & 37x a hypothetical 6% net margin. A mere 80% drop gets to a $132B cap, 4.4x revenues, and to give the bulls on Tesla not being a car company credit, still 37x a 12% hypothetical profit margin. Ridiculous. 54/ 

You can play around all you like w/ assumptions for growth, market share, expansion into new markets, profit & returns on capital, but paying for some fractional ownership of today’s $760B fully diluted market value is highly likely to produce a disastrous investment result. 55/ 

Bravo, S&P. The decision to add $TSLA at present valuation is almost sure to exact pain on passive investors, compelled to “invest” 1.75% of capital in one of the most overvalued companies on record. Brilliant. As the other Buffett sings, “Come Monday, it’ll be all right...” 56/ 

As disclosure, I have a small short position in $TSLA. Don’t take this note as investment advice because it’s not. Do your own research. Stocks go up & down, and shorting is extremely dangerous. Upside is capped and downside is unlimited. $TSLA has risen 8.3x just this year. 57/ 

If Tesla repeats the same return over the next year the market cap would be $6.3 trillion. Two years of repeat performance and the cap becomes $52 trillion. Of course, that’s 70% larger than the entire S&P 500, but by then any short seller is long bankrupt. 58/58 END

TL;DR1: TSLA may go down, not probably but maybe at some point after SP500 inclusion. Why? It's mentioned somewhere in above points comparing it to some historical events and what TSLA makes!

TL;DR2 (from u/rch0wdhury): Yahoo failed after being added in S&P. Tesla can fail, or maybe not.

1529,1529,2020-12-21,"Comparing YHOO AND TSLA Hi all

So now that TSLA is in the S&P let’s compare 

YHOO(1999) was part of the dotcom bubble, a bubble fuelled by the (in hindsight) mostly accurate assumptions that (a) cost of internet is going down (b) user count is going up (c) margins for profit are extremely good (d) economy of scale on the net is infinite. This lead to the assumption that YHOO and its ilk could potentially have a user base of [the world] and hence reap profits from 7bn users for essentially no cost of revenue. (900 PE valuation)

TSLA(2020) is part of the EV/disruptive tech bubble, a bubble fuelled by the speculation that growth of these disruptive industries can in some unspecified way achieve global dominance over existing market leader under the changing climate of (e)environmental policy, (f)government attitudes, and (g)exponential technical development. Unfortunately unlike YHOO it has a high base cost of revenue (manufacturing, research, retooling) and may run into the diseconomies of scale barrier that stymied the growth of many other physical goods companies due to a inherently high retail value of goods sold being a barrier to entry for new users. Arguably its one standout feature is (h)vertical integration something that has historically been successful during the early 1900s seen most prominently in the Trust monopolies (1300PE)

While YHOO and it’s Ilk fell precipitously other new companies that survived the tech bubble collapse (GOOGL, AMZN, FB, MSFT, AAPL, BABA) actually achieved the stated goal of (a-d) and became the largest market leaders seen since The AT&T and early 19th century Trust monopolies.

Are we looking at the next wave of companies coming into existence meeting the e-h criteria that will take over the world? Or is TSLA another canary set to die in the coal mine without any impact.

The report claims that Taiwanese manufacturers are preparing to ramp up for production of ""Apple Car"" components as early as the second quarter of next year, adding that Apple has been secretly testing dozens of prototype vehicles on the road in California. Apple received a permit from California's DMV to test self-driving vehicles in 2017, and it was spotted using Lexus SUVs rigged with LiDAR equipment that year.

While many sources have claimed the Apple Car will be released between 2023 and 2025, including analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, the report cites an unnamed director at a major Taiwanese manufacturer who said Apple is targeting a September 2021 launch.

Here’s where MVIS comes in. MVIS has been working on Lidar tech for 20 years and has a robust patent portfolio. They have both an AR vertical and an autonomous driving vertical. 

MVIS has been confirmed as the key creator of the chip that powers the Microsoft Hololense 2. Look it up it’s dope. The US military’s IVAS program is gonna be buying up a shit ton of these. The Hololense will have more future versions with the realistic end goal of these smart glasses replacing smart phones. There is currently an AR smart glasses war going on between MSFT, FB, AAPL, and GOOG. 

And the Lidar for autonomous vehicles? The CEO of the company specialized in this field at his prior role at Google and said MVIS’s tech will disrupt the market. The autonomous Lidar sample will be ready by APRIL OF 2021 which is way sooner than the other Lidar companies. 

The stock has been on an absolute tear lately. The company has said they’re exploring strategic alternatives which includes the sale of the company and there are several very interested parties.

Now I do invest in small/mid cap stocks on the side for fun and of course profit, so not counting that. But my 2nd main investment that i dont plan on touching will be through 2 strategies; dividend stocks or Large Cap individual stocks? What would you recommend for a 25 year long haul any why?  


Dividend stocks - you typical moderate conservative ticks  
VTI, MCD, MMM, PEP, JPM, DLR, LOW, ADP, NEE, TGT

Large Cap hold onto stocks and invest monthly   
AMZN, NVDA, SQ (believe SQ is a disruptive sector), MSFT, AMD, TSLA, GOOG/GOOGL

&#x200B;

Now my personal thought (based off fundamentals and not really analytical) these large caps will continue to grow and within 10/20 years all of their stock can possibly double or triple along with their market cap. Some analyst believe AMZN might be worth 5k - 10k a stock within 10 years. I know its more of a risk, but I feel with companies this innovative, the risk might not be that bad. Especially $NVDA and its AI research. That is a large market in the near future.   


Now dividend stocks strat, I picked companies where they seem very constant uptrend in revenue, so I can get both, stock profit and of course dividend. the thing is, dividend combined with the amount of stocks invested can be a winner as well in the long run. MCD I dont think is going anywhere. And with less people cooking and eating out, MCD for sure will grow plus dividend.

Ark Invest's Cathie Wood isn't betting on Uber Technologies Inc UBER, -1.55% and LYFT Inc LYFT, -2.42% over Tesla Inc TSLA, +2.44%.

What Happened: Wood, CEO of New York-based Ark Invest, said in a tweet Saturday night that Uber and Lyft missed out on a data opportunity that ties in to AI — and which companies will most benefit from it.

Wood said the ride-sharing companies ""stayed private too long and lost the plot. They could have incentivized their drivers to put sensors on their cars and collect data much faster than even $TSLA.""

The tweet was in response to a question about Ark Invest's portfolio.

Data collection and AI are closely intertwined because machine learning systems develop faster and with greater precision when they are paired with large data sets.

Why It Matters: Wood's opinion carries weight. She has become the breakout star of the 2020 bull market as her actively-managed ETFs generate phenomenal returns. Shares of her ARK Innovation ETF ARKK, -1.43% are up over 163% this year.

“With 180k for 4Q the line in the sand, we believe given the underlying strength we are picking up in China as well as a late push in Europe and the U.S., that 190k-200k is well within reach,” Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives wrote in a commentary.

He added that “while there are some logistics speed bumps throughout Europe that could derail a number of deliveries in the next few days, the theme of the Tesla story and overall global EV demand continues to be around white hot demand coming out of China.”

Credit Suisse analyst Dan Levy also has a neutral rating on Tesla, with a $400 price target. He forecasts 183,000 deliveries this quarter, above what he sees as the sell-side consensus for 163,000 and the likely buy-side consensus for 175,000 to 180,000 deliveries. That would take Tesla to 502,000 deliveries for 2020 as a whole.

With shares up 730%, Tesla bears have seen more than $38 billion in mark-to-market losses this year, according to data from S3 Partners. By comparison, the next-biggest loss for short sellers was on Apple Inc., at just under $7 billion, S3 data shows.

Many of Tesla’s short sellers have closed out their positions over the course of 2020, with short interest falling to 6% of the float from nearly 20% a year ago, according to S3 data.

The next potential catalyst comes in early January, when Tesla reports fourth-quarter vehicle production and delivery figures. Tesla expects to deliver half a million cars in 2020, a huge milestone for a company that initially struggled to mass-produce its Model 3 and is now building additional factories in Berlin and Austin, Texas.

I think (most) people would agree that TSLA is largely overvalued right now and has been for some time. But unlike typical bubble examples, TSLA's price has never really burst like a lot of people expected, and continues to look strong. I'm curious, are there other stocks that were historically similar to this (ie., orders of magnitude overvalued for years), and did they ultimately grow into their valuation over time, or did they eventually see a bubble burst?

Some proper DD. I’m not citing sources, y’all can Google shit.

- They have around $200B cash on hand
- They had 34% increase in sales just on Xmas (278M)
- With the M1 processor, they’ve increased interest in their hardware again. Winning back jaded fanboys and killing the hackintosh community almost overnight.
- Their iPhone 12 sales are rumored to be strongest mobile sales to date.
- The stock is up over 80% in 2020 despite a pandemic

Now for bias and my own opinions:

I’ve been following Apple most of my life. I worked on some of the first hackintosh distros (iatkos) as a broke college student. I can tell you definitively that a massive majority of Apple users are in the digital media and production space. With their prioritization on services the last few years, they’ve really slacked in staying competitive in hardware. They’ve also made some weird plays at being different without actually innovating. That’s changed entirely this year. Their next earnings is going to reflect that. The M1 is a game changer. Almost everyone I know (which is hundreds of people in the digital agency space) have already or are planning on grabbing up Mac mini’s or Airs because of the chip and price point. Apple is also pretty much recession proof. 

My predictions:

- 10% price increase leading up to Q1 earnings just off anticipation.
- 20% price increase post Q1 (probably within a week or two) and pre Q2
- An easy 100% increase by year end.

My play:

1548,1548,2020-12-31,"Why the $TSLA bubble will not burst? A correction (\~-20%) can happen, but the bubble will not burst (where $TSLA loses more than 50%-90% of its value). Here's why:  

So a lot of people often use the dotcom bubble as a parallel to speculate the pop of the Tesla bubble. The most immediate comparisons come from names such as Amazon, which lost nearly 90% of its value from the peak of the bubble but was eventually able to gain back most of its shares. Other comparisons also include stocks such as Yahoo, which was actually added to the S&P 500 in 1999, right before the bubble burst, or even Qualcomm/Cisco. 

These speculations and comparisons are always interesting to think about. They come from deductions, aka where you extrapolate data points from the past in order to predict what is going to happen in the future. However, a deduction is often not the most useful mental model, especially when circumstances are different in the future. And this is one of those cases where the circumstances are actually very different. 

Now the basic argument of ""Tesla is not a car company"" is often overused. Yes, Tesla creates batteries, they are going into the autonomous market soon, their AutoPilot is one of the best AI that the world has today (stronger than NVIDIA's GPUs), they are going to get into the insurance game, they are going to get into the financing industry, some people might even say they are going to collaborate with Space X to create flying cars in 2050. That's all great. However, I'm actually going to argue that despite all of these things, Tesla's current price is overvalued but yet, the stock will not burst. And this has in large part to do with how the markets and trader psychology works today, and how different it is from 1999/2000:

As information and financial data has become more widely available through the internet, the markets have had a tendency to price things way ahead of it's time. For example, Tesla believers (bloggers/Youtubers/communities) can now share their bull case for Tesla and what the company will do years and years down the line. While CEOs and company personnel are not allowed to share such projections due to SEC rules, there is nothing stopping these communities from doing so. The most prominent of this has perhaps been Cathie Wood's ARK Invest. She laid out the case for Tesla way back in 2017, and as some of her projections (such as Tesla's profitability) have proven to be correct, people have now become believers that her entire bull case (of Tesla owning the entire autonomous space) will eventually be correct. In a way, the market has become this binary mechanism. FOMO kicks in due to the widespread information that is available, and people pile in. Now, most Tesla bulls believe in the $7000 PT (pre-split) that Cathie Wood has put on this stock, and I doubt very many people are going to be willing to sell before that price. In 1999, if a hedge fund manager was very bullish on a stock, most other investors had no way of knowing. There has been trend towards open-sourcing investing ideas from many investors, and this is a massive deal with Tesla. Other examples of this include Rob Baron or Chamath, who are also very famous investors and well-known Tesla bulls. 20 years ago, investing ideas were supposed to be secretive, with retail investors very much out of the know and speculating on their own. This is no longer the case today. 

In a way, we now live in an investing world of stories, where the story of a stock matters more than the numbers, and these stories get reverberated through social media communities. What a company will do 20 years down the line is a story that is just now more widely available. So even if Tesla stock drops by 10-15% tomorrow, I believe that there are enough believers in this story where they will just continue to buy up the stock from those prices. ""Buy the dip"" has become this sort of motto in many of these investing communities, and this same theory is true for any of these companies that seem to be outlandishly valued as Tesla. 

The bottom line is: As long as the story stays, the bubble of Tesla will not pop. Even if Tesla has a bad quarter but their long term outlook stays the same, I very much think this will stand true. The only way this bubble pops is if the story changes somehow. That can either be from investors such as ARK saying they no longer believe in the long term hypothesis or other events such as the death of Elon Musk. Otherwise, Tesla will very much continue to stand strong.",TSLA,tsla bubble burst correction 20 happen bubble burst tsla loses 5090 value here lot people often use dotcom bubble parallel speculate pop tesla bubble immediate comparison come name amazon lost nearly 90 value peak bubble eventually able gain back share comparison also include stock yahoo actually added sp 500 1999 right bubble burst even qualcommcisco speculation comparison always interesting think come deduction aka extrapolate data point past order predict going happen future however deduction often useful mental model especially circumstance different future one case circumstance actually different basic argument tesla car company often overused yes tesla creates battery going autonomous market soon autopilot one best ai world today stronger nvidias gpus going get insurance game going get financing industry people might even say going collaborate space x create flying car 2050 thats great however im actually going argue despite thing tesla current price overvalued yet stock burst large part market trader psychology work today different 19992000 information financial data become widely available internet market tendency price thing way ahead time example tesla believer bloggersyoutuberscommunities share bull case tesla company year year line ceo company personnel allowed share projection due sec rule nothing stopping community prominent perhaps cathie wood ark invest laid case tesla way back 2017 projection tesla profitability proven correct people become believer entire bull case tesla owning entire autonomous space eventually correct way market become binary mechanism fomo kick due widespread information available people pile tesla bull believe 7000 pt presplit cathie wood put stock doubt many people going willing sell price 1999 hedge fund manager bullish stock investor way knowing trend towards opensourcing investing idea many investor massive deal tesla example include rob baron chamath also famous investor wellknown tesla bull 20 year ago investing idea supposed secretive retail investor much know speculating longer case today way live investing world story story stock matter number story get reverberated social medium community company 20 year line story widely available even tesla stock drop 1015 tomorrow believe enough believer story continue buy stock price buy dip become sort motto many investing community theory true company seem outlandishly valued tesla bottom line long story stay bubble tesla pop even tesla bad quarter long term outlook stay much think stand true way bubble pop story change somehow either investor ark saying longer believe long term hypothesis event death elon musk otherwise tesla much continue stand strong,Positive,0.9776
